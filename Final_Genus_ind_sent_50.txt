Source: the type strain, ICPT, was isolated from a pyrite enrichment culture established with a sample from an Icelandic geothermal site.
Previously, strain TH3 of the same species was isolated from a copper mine leach dump in the USA (Norris and Barr, 1985).
The TH3 designation was used previously for the original isolate of the species which came from the same source, but was not retained in culture (Brierley, 1978).

Type species: Aeropyrum pernix Sako, Nomura, Uchida, Ishida, Morii, Koga, Hoaki and Maruyama 1996, 1076.
Number of validated species: 1
Cells are resistant to ampicillin, vancomycin, and cycloserine and sensitive to chloramphenicol.
Only di sesterterpanyl (C25C25) glycerol ether lipids are present in the cell membrane.
No fatty acid is detected.
The 23S rRNA of Aeropyrum pernix shares a secondary structural feature with those of the members in the Pyrodictiaceae and Desulfurococcaceae that might be a defining signature.
The helix at positions 1445–1465 (E. coli numbering) in the 23S rRNA secondary structure characterized by a G bulge six nucleotides 5′ from the capping loop and an AG bulge six nucleotides 3′ from the capping loop.
This motif was not found elsewhere in the Archaea domain.
The complete genome sequence has been determined (Kawarabayashi et al., 1999).
A. pernix possesses two family B DNA polymerases (Cann et al., 1999).
On the basis of its hyperthermophily and strict aerobic mode of life, Aeropyrum is distinct from other archaea.
Several members within the Sulfolobales and Thermoplasmatales are able to grow aerobically, depending on the culture conditions.
Sulfolobus spp.
are irregular coccoid shape, and capable of growing under aerobic conditions, either heterotrophically, or chemolithoautotrophically by the oxidation of S0 (Segerer and Stetter, 1989a).
Among them, Sulfolobus solfataricus DSMZ 1616T grows optimally at 87°C (Zillig et al., 1980a).
Acidianus and Desulfurolobus spp.
are facultatively aerobic S0 oxidizers (Zillig et al., 1986b; Segerer and Stetter, 1989b).
Metallosphaera sedula is a strict aerobe, either by heterotrophy or chemolithoautotrophy (Huber et al., 1989a).
Thermoplasma spp.
are facultative aerobes (Langworthy and Smith, 1989).
However, all of them have distinctly lower mol% G + C contents, which range from 31 to 46, and grow optimally below pH 4.0, whereas Aeropyrum pernix has a mol% G + C content of 56 and grows within a pH range from 5.0 to 9.0.
Furthermore, this genus is clearly differentiated from any known member of the Archaea by the idiosyncratic lipid composition and the low level of similarity of the 16S rRNA sequence.

All reports of Alysiella indicate that it is restricted to the oral cavity of warm-blooded vertebrates, where it apparently is nonpathogenic.
Kuhn (1981) suggested that Alysiella can be isolated on BSTSY agar by using the procedures that she used for isolating Simonsiella (see the description of the genus Simonsiella).
Refrigeration is not recommended for preservation of cultures, but they can be preserved by freezing in liquid nitrogen using glycerol as a cryoprotectant or by lyophilization.
The procedures that should be used for characterizing isolates of Alysiella are identical to those used for Simonsiella, and they are presented in the description of that genus.
The unusual morphology of the Alysiella filaments serves to differentiate the genus from all other procaryotic organisms.
Alysiella filaments differ from Simonsiella in consisting of continuous pairs of cells instead of being segmented into units of eight cells, and the terminal cells are not rounded, but square.
In addition, Alysiella has a fringe of fibers on the side of the filament rather than on the bottom as in Simonsiella.
Furthermore, Alysiella does not show the dorsal–ventral, convex–concave curvature of Simonsiella.

Only a single species of Alysiella is currently recognized.
The multicellular spore formers found in the rumen of domestic animals and in the cecum of guinea pigs that Grassè (1924) termed Alysiella filiformis are probably members of the genus Arthromitus (Kuhn, 1981).
Some strains in the literature have been misnamed as A. filiformis (Rossau et al., 1989).

Type species: Angulomicrobium tetraedrale Vasilyeva, Lafitskaya and Namsaraev 1986, 354 (Effective publication: Vasilyeva, Lafitskaya and Namsaraev 1979, 1037.)
Number of validated species: 1
(Reproduced with permission from L.V.
Vasilyeva et al., Microbiologiya 48: 1033–1039, 1979.)
The same cycle is observed for the flat, triangular bacteria.
After separation, growth begins by elongation of the apex of the triangle at the point of division, and new buds are formed synchronously by the mother and daughter cells (Vasilyeva et al., 1979).
DNA hybridization reassociation shows no relation of the mushroom-shaped bacteria to Hyphomicrobium, Rhodopseudomonas, Ancalomicrobium, or Prosthecomicrobium (Stanley et al., 1976).
The flat, triangular strain 1109 differs from the type strains and might be representative of another taxon.
In particular, the shape of its flat cells suggests it may be closer to the prosthecobacteria Stella and Labrys.
However, no further work has been done, and it is premature to establish a new species until additional isolates have been characterized.
Angulomicrobium is differentiated from other genera of budding bacteria by its characteristic morphology.
It differs from Labrys by the absence of prosthecae, and it differs from Nitrobacter and similar budding bacteria by the absence of lamellated membranous structures.
The flat, triangular strain 1109 might be compared with the flat, dividing bacteria with radial symmetry of the genus Stella.
Sequencing 16S rRNA studies indicate that Angulomicrobium tetraedrale (strain WAL-4, Stanley et al., 1976) belongs to the Alphaproteobacteria and is most closely related to Rhodopseudomonas acidophila (now Rhodoblastus acidophilus and R. palustris (Vasilyeva, 1989).

A. pyrophilus can be phylogenetically differentiated from Calderobacterium, Hydrogenobacter, and Thermocrinis by 16S rDNA sequence comparison.
A. pyrophilus may also be differentiated from these genera by a higher maximal growth temperature and by the ability to grow by nitrate reduction under anaerobic conditions.
A. pyrophilus can be further distinguished from Hydrogenobacter and Calderobacterium by (a) its motility and presence of flagella, (b) the formation of H2S from sulfur, (c) the presence of diaminopimelic acid in the murein, and (d) the composition of the lipids.
A. pyrophilus can be further differentiated from Thermocrinis by its growth at higher salinity and by the presence of a regular surface lattice.

Type species: Blastomonas natatoria (Sly 1985) Sly and Cahill 1997, 568 emend.
Hiraishi, Kuraishi and Kawahara 2000a, 1117 (Blastobacter natatorius Sly 1985, 43.)
Number of validated species: 2
Considerable research has been undertaken on the photosynthesis characteristics.
Bacteriochlorophyll a has been detected in the type strains of both B. natatoria and B. ursincola, but the latter strain produces the photosynthetic pigment in higher amounts (Hiraishi et al., 2000a).
B. ursincola was shown to have bacteriochlorophyll a incorporated into the photochemically active photosynthetic reaction center and core light harvesting (LH1) complexes (Yurkov et al., 1997, 1998a, 1998b).
The puf genes coding for proteins of the L and M subunits of the photosynthetic reaction center complex and of the LH1 complex have been detected in both species (Hiraishi et al., 2000a).
B. natatoria and B. ursincola show 4–5% difference in their pufL and pufM gene sequences (Hiraishi et al., 2000a).
Recently, Rickard et al.
(2000) reported that strains of B. natatoria isolated from biofilms (Buswell et al., 1997) demonstrated intraspecies coaggregation between strains and intergeneric coaggregation with Micrococcus luteus.
Coaggregation was maximal in the stationary phase of growth, and each member of a coaggregating pair carried either a heat- and protease-sensitive protein (lectin) adhesin or a saccharide receptor, as coaggregation was reversed by sugars.
No enrichment media have been designed for the isolation of Blastomonas.
The type strain of B. natatoria was isolated from a swimming pool using a Millipore Pseudomonas Count Water Tester (Sly and Hargreaves, 1984).
However, B. natatoria may be grown on dilute media such as Staley's peptone yeast glucose medium (Staley, 1981b) on which the colonies appear pink (Sly, 1985).
On nutrient agar and R2A agar (Reasoner and Geldreich, 1985) colonies are yellow (Sly, 1985; Rickard et al., 2000).
Data from Hiraishi et al.
(2000a).
The genus Blastomonas was described for the type species Blastomonas natatoria (Sly and Cahill, 1997), which was transferred from the genus Blastobacter in which it was originally placed (Sly, 1985).
Phylogenetic analysis of the members of the genus Blastobacter revealed that the genus was polyphyletic and required taxonomic revision (Hugenholtz et al., 1994; Sly and Cahill, 1997).
The second species of the genus, Blastomonas ursincola, was first described as an aerobic bacteriochlorophyll a containing organism and assigned to a new genus Erythromonas, as Erythromonas ursincola, by Yurkov et al.
(1997), even though the type strains of Blastomonas natatoria and Erythromonas ursincola showed 99.8% 16S rRNA sequence similarity.
This taxonomic decision was made with regard to their different physiologies and the important position of photosynthesis in bacterial taxonomy.
However later, Hiraishi et al.
(2000a) demonstrated that Blastomonas natatoria also synthesized bacteriochlorophyll a aerobically and contained puf genes for photosynthesis.
Hiraishi et al.
(2000a) consequently transferred Erythromonas ursincola to Blastomonas and emended the description of the genus to include aerobic bacteriochlorophyll-a-synthesizing bacteria.
The taxonomy of Blastomonas species continues to be subject to differences of opinion, in particular their relationship to the genus Sphingomonas in the family Sphingomonadaceae.
Takeuchi et al.
(2001) proposed that the genus Sphingomonas be split into four separate genera (Sphingomonas sensu stricto, Sphingobium, Novosphingobium, and Sphingopyxis), primarily on phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic evidence, and proposed that the genera Blastomonas and “Rhizomonas” be retained to avoid taxonomic confusion.
Yabuuchi et al.
(1999a), on the other hand, argue that all species in the Sphingomonadaceae, including the species of Blastomonas be combined into the genus Sphingomonas.
Phylogenetically, the genus Blastomonas belongs to the Sphingomonadales, a monophyletic group in the Alphaproteobacteria (Figure 2).
Blastomonas comprises a monophyletic lineage, not robustly affiliated with any other lineage within the Sphingomonadales (including “Rhizomonas”, which is often shown branching with Blastomonas).
There is no reproducible (robust) branching order of lineages within the Sphingomonadales, so it could be argued that all taxa in the Sphingomonadales shown in Figure 2 could be reclassified into the genus Sphingomonas to preserve phylogenetic coherence of the group if a “lumping” strategy was adopted.
However, it could also be argued that all independent monophyletic lineages within the Sphingomonadales (currently there are 10) could be classified as separate genera, thus retaining Blastomonas as a distinct genus.
Applying this criterion, several species of Sphingomonas in Figure 2 would need to be re-classified according to their generic affiliation, and Erythrobacter, Erythromicrobium, and Porphyrobacter may need to be reclassified into a single genus.
Papers by Sly and Cahill (1997), Takeuchi et al.
(2001), and Yurkov et al.
(1997) argue on phylogenetic evidence that Blastomonas belongs to a deep separate lineage without a close relationship to the genus Sphingomonas.
Hiraishi et al.
(2000a) proposes that Blastomonas should be retained on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, particularly its budding morphology and photosynthesis capacity, which clearly separate it from Sphingomonas.
On the other hand, Yabuuchi et al.
(1999a) have proposed the transfer of B. natatoria and B. ursincola to the genus Sphingomonas.
Figure 2.

The outgroups used were Rhodospirillum rubrum, Rhodobacter capsulatus, and Agrobacterium tumefaciens.
Robust internal nodes (>90 bootstrap confidence) are indicated by a solid circle on the node.
The intra-order sequence divergence within the Sphingomonadales is 9%.
On balance, the authors support the retention of the genus Blastomonas at this time to avoid taxonomic confusion.
Based on budding morphology and aerobic bacteriochlorophyll a synthesis, Blastomonas can easily be differentiated from Sphingomonas.
Hiraishi et al.
(2000a) support the retention of the genus Blastomonas and note that whereas most species of the genus Sphingomonas contain monosaccharide- and oligosaccharide-type glycosphingolipids, B. natatoria and B. ursincola contain monosaccharide-type glycosphingolipids only.

In the previous edition of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology (Volume 1, 1984), the family contained a single genus, Chlamydia.
The family was emended to include an additional genus, Chlamydophila, by Everett et al.
in 1999.
The new genus and five species, Chlamydophila abortus, Chlamydophila caviae, Chlamydophila felis, Chlamydophila pecorum, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Chlamydophila psittaci were validly published, but the scientific community has not uniformly adopted the use of the new genus name.
For this reason, in this edition of the Manual the original genus Chlamydia is retained as the sole genus in the family and the five additional species are classified in the genus.

Number of validated species: 1
The current isolates all contain BChl c as the main light-harvesting pigment, together with a small quantity of BChl a (c:a = 50:1).
More than 80% of the carotenoid is γ-carotene in the type species.
Chloroherpeton differs from the multicellular filamentous green bacteria Chloronema (Dubinina and Gorlenko, 1975), Oscillochloris (Gorlenko and Pivovarova, 1977), and Chloroflexus (Pierson and Castenholz, 1974a) in cell dimensions, in being unicellular rather than filamentous, and in photosynthetic pigment composition.
The differences among the other genera of the green sulfur bacteria are listed in Table 1.

Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences available from the European Molecular Biology Laboratory database (accession no.s are given in parentheses) constructed after multiple alignment of data by clustal_x (Thompson et al., 1997).
Distances (distance options according to the Kimura-2 model) and clustering with the neighbor-joining method were performed by using the software packages mega (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) version 2.1 (Kumar et al., 2001).
Bootstrap values based on 1000 replications are listed as percentages at the branching points.
(Data from Kämpfer et al., 2006).
In the field of reclassification of the bacilli, there is still a discussion as to what constitutes the genus Bacillus and whether other genera created over the years should be either further split or combined.
In creating the genus Cohnella it was important to show that it could be clearly distinguished from the members of the genus Bacillus and also from members of the genus Paenibacillus (Kämpfer et al., 2006).
One solution is to define the properties of the type species of these genera (i.e., Bacillus and Paenibacillus) and to create new genera where clear differences are to be found based on a combination of 16S rDNA sequence data, chemical composition, physiology, and biochemical properties.
Data for Cohnella thermotolerans and Cohnella hongkongensis are based on the type strains (Kämpfer et al., 2006).
Data for Bacillus subtilis and Paenibacillus polymyxa were taken from Kämpfer (2002) and are compiled from several species descriptions.

Number of validated species: 1
On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, D. baarsii falls into the Deltaproteobacteria and forms a distinct lineage.
The closest relatives are Desulfosarcina variabilis, Desulfonema magnum, Desulfonema limicola, and Desulfococcus multivorans (Family Desulfobacteraceae).
A signature sequence for Desulfarculus baarsii (also for Desulfomonile tiedjei and Syntrophus species) is 5′-GCCGGTGCTTCCTTTGGCGG-3′ (oligonucleotide probe DSMA 488), which binds to the 16S rDNA at E. coli position 5′-488–507-3′ (Manz et al., 1998).

Number of validated species: 1
Desulfobotulus strains occur in anoxic mud of freshwater environments.
Enrichment can be accomplished with palmitate (see below).
However enrichment is not highly specific.
For the enrichment of Desulfobotulus strains, palmitate-sulfate medium1 may be used.
However, a highly selective medium for D. sapovorans has not been reported.
Palmitate may also support growth of other sulfate-reducing bacteria, which may also have vibrio-shaped cells (but often smaller than D. sapovorans); oxidation of palmitate by such bacteria is usually also incomplete.

Type species: Desulfohalobium retbaense Ollivier, Hatchikian, Prensier, Guezennec and Garcia 1991, 78.
Number of validated species: 1
A soluble extract of D. retbaense exhibits the characteristic absorption bands of cytochrome c3.
Desulfoviridin, the dissimilatory sulfite reductase present in most species of the genus Desulfovibrio (Devereux et al., 1989), is absent.
Desulfohalobium retbaense possesses a desulforubidin bisulfite reductase similar to that of Desulfomicrobium norvegicum (Lee et al., 1973; Sharak Genthner et al., 1994, 1997a).
However, the absorption spectrum of Desulfohalobium retbaense bisulfite reductase differs slightly from that of the homologous protein of Desulfomicrobium norvegicum in that the former has an additional weak absorption band at 700 nm and a more distinguishable shoulder in the 580-nm region.
Differentiation of the genus from the genera Desulfomicrobium and Desulfonatronovibrio, with which it might be confused, is presented in Table 1.
Major differences between Desulfohalobium retbaense and the six other moderately halophilic sulfate-reducing species, namely Desulfovibrio halophilus, Desulfovibrio gabonensis, Desulfovibrio oxyclinae, Desulfovibrio profundus, Desulfovibrio vietnamensis, and Desulfocella halophila are listed in Table 2.

Desulfohalobium retbaense is currently a member of the family Desulfohalobiaceae in the Deltaproteobacteria, together with the genera Desulfonatronovibrio and Desulfothermus (Figure 2).
However, we believe that future revision of the family Desulfohalobiaceae should be considered in view of the following: (1) Desulfohalobium retbaense together with Desulfonatronovibrio hydrogenovorans and Desulfothermus naphtae are closely related to members of the genus Desulfomicrobium; (2) desulfoviridin is absent in Desulfohalobium retbaense, in Desulfonatronovibrio hydrogenovorans, in Desulfothermus naphtae, and in members of the genus Desulfomicrobium, but is found in all members of the genus Desulfovibrio (Devereux et al., 1989); and (3) desulforubidin is present in Desulfohalobium retbaense (Ollivier et al., 1991), Desulfomicrobium baculatum (Der-Vartanian, 1994), and Desulfomicrobium norvegicum (Lee et al., 1973; Sharak Genthner et al., 1994, 1997a).
However, the presence of desulforubidin has yet to be investigated in Desulfonatronovibrio hydrogenovorans (Zhilina et al., 1997), Desulfothermus naphtae (Rueter et al., 1994), and Desulfomicrobium spp.
(Rozanova et al., 1988; Gogotova and Vainshtein, 1989; Sharak Genthner et al., 1994; Krumholz et al., 1999; Langendijk et al., 2001).
If it is detected in these species, then the establishment of a new family should be considered in order to accommodate members of the genera Desulfohalobium, Desulfonatronovibrio, Desulfothermus, and Desulfomicrobium.

Phylogenetic relationship, based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis, of Desulfohalobium retbaense, a member of the family Desulfohalobiaceae, with other members of that family, including Desulfonatronovibrio hydrogenovorans and Desulfothermus naphthae TD3; and with species of the genera Desulfovibrio (family Desulfovibrionaceae) and Desulfomicrobium (family Desulfomicrobiaceae).
All sequences were obtained from the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) (Maidak et al., 1996), with the exception of the sequences for Desulfonatronovibrio hydrogenovorans and Desulfovibrio oxyclinae, which were obtained from EMBL (accession number X99234) and GenBank (accession number U33316), respectively.
The methods for alignment and phylogenetic evaluation were performed as described previously (Andrews and Patel, 1996).

Type species: Desulfomonile tiedjei DeWeerd, Mandelco, Tanner, Woese and Suflita 1991, 178 (Effective publication: DeWeerd, Mandelco, Tanner, Woese and Suflita 1990, 28.)

D. tiedjei reductively dehalogenates meta-chlorobenzoates, ortho- and meta-bromobenzoates, and all isomers of iodobenzoate to benzoate as a form of anaerobic respiration.
D. tiedjei also dechlorinates meta-chlorine substituents from pentachlorophenol and tri- and di-chlorophenols and dechlorinates tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene, but it requires a meta-halobenzoate or a number of benzenoid analogs to induce these activities (Mohn and Tiedje, 1992).
D. tiedjei reduces sulfate, sulfite, thiosulfate, and dithionite to sulfide, nitrate to nitrite, and fumarate to succinate.
The presence of sulfur oxyanions in growth medium inhibits reductive dehalogenation activity (Townsend and Suflita, 1997).
D. tiedjei cannot reduce S0, Fe(III), or U(Vl).
Pyruvate, 3-anisate, 4-anisate, vanillate, or isovanillate can support growth in the mineral medium buffered with bicarbonate.
With thiosulfate as the electron acceptor, additional carbon substrates that can support growth are benzoate, butyrate, lactate, acetate, l- and d-malate, l- and d-arabinose, and glycerol.
With sulfate as the electron acceptor, D. tiedjei can grow with pyruvate, lactate, butyrate, and 3-anisate as sources of carbon and energy.
In mineral salts medium containing the essential vitamins, D. tiedjei grows poorly as a chemolithoautotroph with hydrogen or formate as the electron donor and sulfur oxyanions or meta-chlorobenzoates as electron acceptors.
The addition of acetate to the medium stimulates growth under these conditions.
Growth of D. tiedjei on acetate and thiosulfate occurs by utilizing the disproportionation of the latter as an energy source (Mohn and Tiedje, 1990).
D. tiedjei requires nicotinamide, thiamine, and 1,4-naphthoquinone as growth factors in defined medium.
Although NH4Cl is supplied as the nitrogen source in the medium, D. tiedjei can fix N2 for growth.
Initiation of growth is favored by the addition of dithionite as a reductant.
The bacterium is inhibited by H2S, CuCl2, Na2MoO4, or Na2SeO4.
D. tiedjei is sensitive to the electron transport inhibitors carbonyl-cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazine (CCCP), 8-hydroxyquinoline, diphenylamine, dimercaprol, metronidazole, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), pentachlorophenol (PCP), gramicidin, and monensin.
Antibiotics that inhibit D. tiedjei are tetracycline, chloramphenicol, kanamycin, and streptomycin.
The genus Desulfomonile is distinguished from other dissimilatory sulfate-reducing bacteria by its characteristic morphological and physiological attributes.
Members of this genus contain an invagination of the cell wall, or “collar structure,” which is visible under phase contrast microscopy.
This feature is not present in other genera of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
The ability of Desulfomonile tiedjei to reductively dehalogenate various halogenated benzoates distinguishes this bacterium from all of the other sulfate-reducing genera described.
Desulfitobacterium chlororespirans can dechlorinate 3-chloro-4-hydroxybenzoate, but is unable to dechlorinate 3-chlorobenzoate (Sanford et al., 1996).
Desulfomonile tiedjei possesses the ability to dechlorinate the meta-chlorines of pentachlorophenol and several tri- and dichlorophenols.
However, this activity must be induced by a meta-halobenzoate or a specific analog (Mohn and Kennedy, 1992).
Other isolated bacteria that can dechlorinate chlorophenols are Desulfitobacterium species, which dechlorinate chlorophenols at the ortho position—including Desulfitobacterium hafniense, which dechlorinates at the ortho and meta positions, and Desulfitobacterium frappieri, which dechlorinates at all positions.
Desulfitobacterium species can reduce thiosulfate, but not sulfate, and are placed in the Desulfotomaculum–Clostridium group.
Desulfomonile tiedjei can also reductively dechlorinate tetra- and trichloroethylene, but this activity must be induced with 3-chlorobenzoate or a suitable analog.
A large and diverse group of isolated anaerobic bacteria can also dechlorinate PCE and TCE.
The anaerobic dechlorination activity of isolated bacteria has recently been summarized (El Fantroussi et al., 1998).
The induction of the dehalogenase by Desulfomonile tiedjei is repressed by the presence of sulfur oxyanions, and sulfate and thiosulfate also directly inhibit the dehalogenation activity of the enzyme.
The ability of Desulfomonile tiedjei to grow via the disproportionation of thiosulfate is a trait that is also found in Desulfovibrio sulfodismutans, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans CSN, Desulfovibrio oxyclinae, Desulfocapsa thiozymogenes, and several other strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria.
The ability to fix nitrogen is found among members of the genera Desulfovibrio, Desulfotomaculum, and Desulfobacter.
Two characteristic lipopolysaccharide hydroxy fatty acids (CBr-19:0 3OH and CBr-21:0 3OH) have been used as signature molecules to detect Desulfomonile tiedjei inoculated in sediments (Ringelberg et al., 1994).
Desulfomonile tiedjei was also detected in soil slurry microcosms using five specific oligonucleotide primers for PCR amplification of 16S rDNA genes of D. tiedjei.
The five oligonucleotide primers used in a nested PCR analysis were located at 16S rRNA gene positions 59–79, 205–227, 476–495, 608–628, and 1032–1054 (El Fantroussi et al., 1997).
Cell-specific polyclonal antibodies were also used to detect D. tiedjei in an upflow anaerobic granular-sludge blanket reactor (Ahring et al., 1992).
The 16S rRNA of Desulfomonile shows two higher order structural features that link it strongly to the Deltaproteobacteria: (1) a lengthening of the stalk of the helix covering positions 184–193 from three pairs (characteristic of the Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria) to about ten pairs and (2) a form of the helix covering positions 198–219 unique to the Deltaproteobacteria (Woese, 1987).
16S rRNA sequence analysis indicates that the genus belongs to the family Syntrophaceae family in the order Syntrophobacterales of the Deltaproteobacteria.
The family Syntrophaceae contains two syntrophic genera (Syntrophus and Smithella) and one other sulfate-reducing genus (Desulfobacca).

Unicellular cyanobacteria that have apical-basal polarity (i.e., ovoid to pyriform in shape), and that reproduce only by multiple fission (i.e., do not exhibit binary fission).
Baeocytes are immotile, possessing an outer fibrous wall layer at the time of release from the parental cell.
This genus is considered valid at this time only because of the distinct heteropolarity of the mature cells.
Komárek and Anagnostidis (1998), using morphological, ecological, and pigment criteria of field material, propose that there are eight species of Cyanocystis.
However, this can only be confirmed after more representatives of this genus have been isolated and analyzed genetically.

The generic nomen Dactylococcopsis has a complex history, since it may have been used originally for a green alga (Ankistrodesmus) (Komárek, 1969; 1983).
Two alternative botanical genera for cyanobacteria exhibiting the morphological properties of strain PCC 8305 have been described: Myxobactron Schmidle 1904 and Rhabdogloea Schröder 1917 (see Komárek and Anagnostidis, 1986).
However, the type material of Myxobactron was reported to contain only diatoms (see Komárek, 1983; Komárek and Anagnostidis, 1986) and is thus of doubtful validity.
Komárek (1983) proposed to transfer several species (Dactylococcopsis smithii R. et F. Chaudat 1925, Dactylococcopsis linearis Geitler 1935, and Dactylococcopsis planctonica Teiling 1942) to the genus Rhabdogloea, even though the authenticity of the type species (Rhabdogloea ellipsoidea Schröder 1917) had not been reconfirmed.
Disregarding this proposal, Komárek and Anagnostidis (1986) subsequently concluded that the isolate of Walsby et al.
(1983) should be assigned to Myxobactron salinum.
We here retain the original epithets of Walsby et al., Dactylococcopsis salina, since the name Dactylococcopsis antedates that of Myxobactron and Rhabdogloea and thus has priority, and the three genera were considered to be synonymous (Geitler, 1942).

Although some members resemble Prochlorothrix morphologically, the genus can be distinguished by the lack of chlorophyll b and possession of APC and PC in Limnothrix strains.
In addition, some synthesize PE and may or may not undergo complementary chromatic adaptation.
Isolation by removal of trichomes from agar plates after a series of washings, filtrations with membrane filters of 8 µm pore size, and dilutions (see Meffert and Chang, 1978 for details); Medium Z8, or BG11o containing sodium nitrate (2 mM) (Rippka, 1988a).
PCC 9416 (SAG 3.89), a PE-rich axenic culture of L. redekei strain Meffert N8 7206E, isolated from plankton (Edebergsee, E. Holstein, Germany; Meffert and Chang, 1978).
The taxon Limnothrix as defined here is based mainly on the studies by Meffert (Meffert and Oberhäuser, 1982; Meffert, 1987, 1988) and includes isolates (or descriptions) of species previously assigned to Oscillatoria (e.g., O. redekei van Goor, O. amphigranulata van Goor, O. planktonica Wolosz., O. rosea Utermöhl).
The only strain of Limnothrix analyzed (Meffert 6705) clusters in the 16S rRNA tree with strains of Pseudanabaena (Turner, 1997; Wilmotte and Herdman, this volume).
Unfortunately, this isolate is no longer available (Meffert, personal communication).
Therefore, until additional isolates and sequences have been compared, it seems preferable to retain Limnothrix as a separate genus.

This organism, along with Prochloron Lewin 1977 and Prochlorococcus Chisholm et al.
1992 was until recently, considered a member of a “new” and separate order (Prochlorales) and phylum (Prochlorophyta); hence the separate treatment of these organisms (except for Prochlorococcus which had not yet been discovered) in the last edition of this Manual (see Burger-Wiersma and Mur, 1989; Lewin, 1989).
This classification was based on the marked difference in pigment composition and thylakoid structure (including lack of phycobilisomes) between these “green” oxyphotobacteria and the more typical phycobiliprotein-containing cyanobacteria.
The pigment complement and thylakoid stacking of this organism resemble the photosynthetic machinery encountered in the chloroplasts of green algae and higher plants.
It was therefore proposed that members of this group represent the living descendents of an ancient lineage that, in the course of evolution involving an endosymbiotic event, gave rise to the chloroplasts, hence the Prochlorophyta.
However, recent phylogenetic analyses have demonstrated that representatives of these three “prochloralian” genera do not represent a coherent cluster particularly affiliated with chloroplasts.
On the contrary, examination of these data lead to the conclusion that chloroplasts evolved in multiple and independent events within the cyanobacterial radiation (see Palenik and Swift, 1996; Turner, 1997; Urbach et al., 1998; see also Wilmotte and Herdman, this volume).
Consequently, all three “prochloralian” members are now regarded as cyanobacteria (Urbach et al., 1992) and the phylum Prochlorophyta and order Prochlorales are rejected.
For descriptions of Prochloron and Prochlorococcus, the reader may consult Subsection I (this Manual).

The definition of Stanieria given here corresponds entirely to that of the genus Dermocarpa (sensu Waterbury and Stanier 1978).
However, the nomenclatural change was made based on a proposition by Komárek and Anagnostidis (1986).
These authors proposed to invalidate the genus name Dermocarpa on the grounds that the original description of Dermocarpa violacea Crouan 1858 was doubtful (see also Hua et al., 1989), and created a new genus, Stanieria Komárek and Anagnostidis 1986, to accommodate baeocyte-forming species exhibiting the structural and developmental properties of Dermocarpa (sensu Waterbury and Stanier 1978).
The generic nomen Stanieria was created to honor Roger Y. Stanier, who pioneered the creation of a cyanobacterial taxonomy based on a polyphasic approach using pure cultures.

PCC 9215, isolated by H. Rodriguez from a coastal lagoon, Albufera de Valencia, Valencia, Spain.
Carried in the PCC as Anabaenopsis sp.
(Rippka and Herdman, 1992).
Mol% G + C is 43.2.
PCC 9420, isolated by E. Hegewald from Lake Nakuru, Kenya, and identified as Anabaenopsis elenkinii (co-identic with SAG 252.80) (Schlösser, 1984).
Mol% G + C is 43.1.
In the last edition, Castenholz (1989b) combined this genus with Anabaena, but suggested that it may warrant independent generic status.
Recent 16S rRNA gene sequence data (Iteman et al., 1999) demonstrated that Anabaenopsis PCC 9215 is distant in the phylogenetic tree from both Anabaena cylindrica PCC 7122 and Anabaena flos-aquae PCC 9302.
Thus its generic separation is justified, even though isolates of Anabaena flos-aquae have also been reported to produce helical coiled variants in culture (Booker and Walsby, 1979; see also Castenholz, 1989b).
Iteman et al.
(1999) also showed that Anabaenopsis PCC 9215 clusters relatively closely with Cyanospira rippkae PCC 9501 (see Wilmotte and Herdman, this volume).
Unfortunately, no DNA–DNA hybridization data are available to correlate total genomic relatedness, necessary to validate generic distinctions, with the observed degree of 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence between the latter two strains.
Anabaenopsis as the older genus has legal priority over Cyanospira Florenzano et al., 1985.
Thus, if these two “genera” would eventually need to be combined, only Cyanospira would lose validity.

Cyanospira is one of the rare genera whose description was made under the rules of the Bacteriological Code of Nomenclature, and both species are based on cultured representatives.
Cyanobacteria assigned to this new genus resemble both Anabaena spiroides and some “species” traditionally assigned to Anabaenopsis.
However, they can be distinguished from the former (a typical freshwater inhabitant) by having a higher salt requirement and from the latter by some morphological features (some of which may be more trivial than others): the coiled filaments are longer; uneven cell division leading to two transiently paired heterocysts is never observed; akinetes are spherical and occur in chains, often comprising a significant part of the trichomes.
In agreement with their similar ecology, Cyanospira PCC 9501 and Anabaenopsis PCC 9215 cluster relatively tightly in the 16S rRNA tree (Iteman et al., 1999; see also Wilmotte and Herdman, this volume).
However, for lack of DNA–DNA hybridization studies, it is presently unknown whether these two genera will eventually need to be combined (in which case Anabaenopsis would have legal priority) or whether both can be justified.
Since no 16S rRNA sequence data are available for Anabaena spiroides, the relationship between the latter and Cyanospira remains unknown.

Most of the information on Fischerella in culture has been obtained from the thermophilic species, which are common in neutral pH and alkaline hot springs throughout the world (Castenholz, 1978, 1996).
However, Martin and Wyatt (1974) have compared the physiology of six strains of stigonematalean cyanobacteria, including five strains of three species of Fischerella, none of which were thermophilic.
Besides the true branching habit, the great diversity of form as described by Frémy (1936), Schwabe (1960a), Rippka et al.
(1979), and Balkwill et al.
(1984) for Fischerella (Mastigocladus cf.
laminosus) also applies to these nonthermophilic representatives.
In the nonthermophilic strains, hormogonia were not always formed under conditions favorable for their production, and sometimes the multiseriate condition of the axis was rare or lacking.
Thurston and Ingram (1971) have studied the morphology and fine structure of another nonthermophilic species of Fischerella, in which they have shown details of synaptic connections, with microplasmodesmata joining adjacent cells in the branch trichomes (Figure 3).
(Reprinted with permission from E.L. Thurston and L.O.
Ingram, ©Journal of Phycology 7: 203–210, 1971.)
The several strains used for the description of Fischerella by Rippka et al.
(1979) were all thermophiles ascribed to the genus Mastigocladus.
Prepared as a 20-fold concentrated stock, stored at 4°C.
Micronutrients and FeCl3 are included in the stock.
pH is adjusted to 8.2 with NaOH before autoclaving.
After cooling and clearing, pH is about 7.5.
Several variations of this medium are described in Castenholz, 1988a.
Waterbury and Stanier, 1981.
Ni and Se have recently been added by Castenholz.
Concentrations are usually designed for additions of 1 ml/l.
Vitamin mixes are generally filter sterilized and added after the medium is autoclaved.
No cyanobacteria have been shown to have a complex vitamin requirement; most have none at all.
Ong and Glazer, 1984.
PCC 7115 (ATCC 27929), isolated from Tassajara Hot Springs, California (Rippka et al., 1979) as Mastigocladus species H2; and PCC 7522 (ATCC 29539, CCMEE NZ-86-m), isolated from a hot spring, Whakarewarewa, New Zealand (Rippka et al., 1979) as Mastigocladus laminosus.
Herpyzonema, known from terrestrial (cave) and marine habitats, is similar to Fischerella and Hapalosiphon, but has typical Y-branchings which originate after the formation of lateral loops (Hernández-Mariné and Canals, 1994).
For the present, there appears to be insufficient reason to separate the genera Mastigocladus and Hapalosiphon from Fischerella.
The boundaries separating these three genera are not clear for all described species (see Geitler, 1932; Desikachary, 1959; Bourrelly, 1985).
Furthermore, strains variously identified by their isolators as members of these three genera have indeed been shown by DNA–DNA hybridization to be closely related and are probable members of the same genus (Rippka and Herdman, 1992).
The original description of Mastigocladus Cohn 1862 gave insufficient information, and subsequent redefinitions have attempted to use the possession of Y-branches, in addition to true and false branches, to distinguish Mastigocladus from Fischerella (Schwabe, 1960a) or to establish Mastigocladus laminosus as Hapalosiphon laminosus (Frémy, 1936).
Although such Y-branches do occur in some strains (see Figure 1B), this characteristic does not warrant separation of Mastigocladus as a separate genus until further study is completed.
The main difference between Mastigocladus and Fischerella on the one hand, and Hapalosiphon on the other hand, is the presence of branches similar to the main axis in Hapalosiphon, whereas they differ in the other two genera.
Rippka and Herdman (1992) distinguish two clusters within the genus Fischerella, for which they propose the names F. muscicola and F. thermalis.

Two other genera with lateral heterocysts exist.
Mastigocladopsis Iyengar and Desikachary 1946 (Figure 1), characterized by Y-branchings, is found in the soil or forms macroscopic benthic colonies in running freshwaters.
Its ultrastructure, including its pit-like synapses, and morphological variability in culture have been studied by Hernández-Mariné et al.
(1992) and Hoffmann (1994).
Mastigocoleus forms only lateral T-branchings and is probably a cosmopolitan endolith in marine carbonate substrates.
Its ultrastructure has been studied by Pantazidou (1991).

Stigonema cf.
ocellatum and S. cf.
minutum have been isolated in culture, but taxonomic studies have not been made (Zehnder, 1985).
Stigonema is a freshwater or subaerial (terrestrial) genus found commonly on moist rocks or soil or in oligotrophic, slightly acidic lakes and some streams.
Conspicuous tufted benthic mats of Stigonema occur in some oligotrophic lakes.
Some of the species are also photobionts in lichen symbioses.

Type species: Fusobacterium nucleatum Knorr 1922, 17AL [Bacillus fusiformis Veillon and Zuber 1898, 540 and other combinations using “Fusiformis” except the organism described as Fusobacterium fusiforme by Hoffman in the 7th edition of the Manual; Group I, Spaulding and Rettger 1937, 535; Group III (and probably Fusobacterium polymorphum) Baird-Parker 1960, 458; not Fusobacterium plauti-vincentii Knorr 1922, 5.
Number of validated species: 14
Fusobacterium periodonticum is phylogenetically similar to Fusobacterium nucleatum (Jousimies-Somer and Summanen, 2002).
Fusobacterium nucleatum-like isolates from cats and dogs were found to be distinct from Fusobacterium nucleatum both in their 16S rRNA and DNA–DNA hybridization.
These have been reclassified as Fusobacterium canifelinum which are resistant to levofloxacin (MIC >4 µg/ml) and other fluoroquinolones.
The resistance is due to two substitutions in the quinolone resistance determining region of gyrA relative to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
The first replacement is of Ser79 with leucine and the second is Gly83 is replaced with arginine (Conrads et al., 2005).
Genetic differences between the species have been reported in leukotoxin A (lktA) between both subspecies (Narayanan et al., 2001).
Subspecies necrophorum is more frequently isolated, often in pure culture, from liver abscesses than subsp.
funduliforme.
Leukotoxin, an exotoxin, is a major virulence factor.
In Fusobacterium necrophorum subsp.
necrophorum, Lkt is a high-molecular-mass protein that is encoded by a tricistronic leukotoxin operon (lktBAC) and induces apoptosis and necrosis of bovine leukocytes in a dose-dependent manner.
The subsp.
funduliforme produces lower concentration of leukotoxin and hence is less virulent than subsp.
necrophorum.
The low toxicity associated with subsp.
funduliforme leukotoxin, a less virulent subspecies, may in part be due to the differences in the lktA gene and reduced transcription (Tadepalli et al., 2008).
Amino acids are imported as monomers, di-, or oligopeptides, and an active transport of the dipeptide l-cysteinglycine has been detected in Fusobacterium nucleatum (Carlsson et al., 1994).
The genome of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.
nucleatum (strain ATCC 25586T) contains 2.17 Mb encoding 2067 open reading frames (ORFs) organized on a single circular chromosome (Kapatral et al., 2002).
About 2.3% of the ORFs are unique to Fusobacterium nucleatum.
The genome analysis has revealed several key aspects of the pathways of organic acid, amino acid, carbohydrate, and lipid metabolism.
Nine very-high-molecular-mass outer-membrane proteins are predicted from the sequence, none of which has been reported in the literature.
More than 137 transporters for the uptake of a variety of substrates such as peptides, sugars, metal ions, and cofactors have been identified.
Biosynthetic pathways exist for only three amino acids: glutamate, aspartate, and asparagine.
The remaining amino acids are imported as such or as di- or oligopeptides that are subsequently degraded in the cytoplasm.
A principal source of energy appears to be the fermentation of glutamate to butyrate.
Additionally, desulfuration of cysteine and methionine yields ammonia, H2S, methyl mercaptan, and butyrate, which are capable of arresting fibroblast growth, thus preventing wound healing and aiding penetration of the gingival epithelium.
Analysis of the draft genome sequence of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.
vincentii (ATCC 49256), and comparison of this sequence to the genome ATCC 25586 sequence resolved that 441 ORFs have no orthologs in strain ATCC 25586.
Of these, 118 ORFs have no known function and are unique, whereas 323 ORFs have functional orthologs in other organisms.
Genes for eukaryotic serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase, transpeptidase E-transglycosylase Pbp1A were also identified among the ATCC 49256-specific ORFs.
Unique ABC transporters, cryptic phages, and three types of restriction-modification systems have been identified in ATCC 49256.
ORFs for ethanolamine utilization, thermostable carboxypeptidase, glutamyl-transpeptidase, and deblocking aminopeptidases are absent from ATCC 49256.
Both strains lack a catalase-peroxidase system, but possess thioredoxin/glutaredoxin enzymes.
Genes for resistance to antibiotics such as acriflavin, bacitracin, bleomycin, daunorubicin, florfenicol, and other general multidrug resistance are present (Kapatral et al., 2003)
The genome of Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.
polymorphum ATCC 10953 contains a chromosome of approximately 2.4 Mbp and a plasmid (pFN3) of 11.9 kbp, and there are 2361 proteins encoded in the genome.
Plasmid pFN3 from the strain was also sequenced and analyzed.
When compared to the other two available fusobacterial genomes (Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.
nucleatum and Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.
vincentii) 627 ORFs unique to Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.
polymorphum ATCC 10953 were identified.
A large percentage of these mapped within one of 28 regions or islands containing five or more genes.
Seventeen percent of the clustered proteins that demonstrated similarity were most similar to proteins from the clostridia, with others being most similar to proteins from other Gram-stain-positive organisms such as Bacillus and Streptococcus.
A 10 kb region homologous to the Salmonella typhimurium propanediol utilization locus was identified, as was a prophage and integrated conjugal plasmid.
The genome contains five composite ribozyme/transposons similar to the CdISt IStrons described in Clostridium difficile.
Fusobacterium are normal inhabitants of the mucous membrane of humans and animals.
The habitat of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Fusobacterium periodonticum is the human oral cavity; the gingival crevice is the niche of both.
Strains are isolated from the oral microflora of adults and children and are also found in edentulous infants.
The vagina is likely to be the primary endogenous site for Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium gonidiaformans (Hill, 1993).
The habitat of Fusobacterium mortiforum and Fusobacterium varium is the gastrointestinal tract, where they are present in small numbers.
Fusobacterium necrogenes, which was originally isolated from a chicken abscess and from cecal contents of ducks, is very rarely isolated from humans.
The habitat of Fusobacterium ulcerans, isolated from tropical ulcers, is unknown.
Fusobacterium russii is normally found in the canine and feline oral flora (Love et al., 1987), but it has also been isolated from human feces.
The oral cavity of horses and the stump-tailed macaque (Macaca arctoides) are the habitat of Fusobacterium equinum and Fusobacterium simiae, respectively.
Fusobacterium canifelinum was isolated from the microflora of infected cat and dog bite wounds in humans (Conrads et al., 2005).

These two strains were isolated from salterns in the Hainan Province of China.
With the recent splitting of the order Halobacteriales, at the time the single order in the class Halobacteria and the family Halobacteriaceae into three orders and three families, the genus was retained in the family Halobacteriaceae (Gupta et al.
2015).

Type species: Herpetosiphon aurantiacus Holt and Lewin 1968, 2408.
Number of validated species: 2
The genus Herpetosiphon in the 1st edition of Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology included five species, all of which had been validated.
The original description and naming by J. Holt and R.A. Lewin in 1968 was for H. aurantiacus strain ATCC 23779.
Subsequently Lewin (1970) published a description of the four other species of this genus, all of which had phenotypic similarities to H. aurantiacus.
However, 16S rDNA sequence analyses (>1417 nucleotides) by Sly et al.
(1998) have shown that only H. geysericola Lewin (1970) shows a close relationship to the type species, H. aurantiacus (96.4% similarity), indicative of separate species status within this genus.
The other three species included in the 1st edition of the Manual are closely related to each other but not to the H. aurantiacus/H.
geysericola clade.
These three have been proposed as species of a new genus, Lewinella gen. nov., that is allied with the Flexibacter/Bacteroides/Cytophaga (FBC) phylum (Sly et al., 1998).
These former Herpetosiphon species [i.e., H. cohaerens Lewin (1970), H. persicus Lewin (1970), and H. nigricans Lewin (1970)] have now been renamed as species (comb.
nov.) of the newly described genus Lewinella Sly, Taghavit and Fegan 1998.
They will not be included in the following discussion of Herpetosiphon.
Sequence analyses of 16S rRNA has consistently shown that the type species (Herpetosiphon aurantiacus strain ATCC 23779) is closely related to Chloroflexus aurantiacus (see phylogenetic tree under “Chloroflexales”).
This relationship is supported by similar biochemical and structural properties, such as the lack of an LPD outer membrane, and the replacement of meso-diaminopimelic acid (meso-DAP) by ornithine in both groups.
This Chloroflexus/Herpetosiphon line is one of the first evolutionary branches of the Bacteria, and consistently shows itself to be the earliest branch with photosynthetic members.
Other photosynthetic genera of this clade have been described earlier.
The first described species of Chloroflexus (C. aurantiacus Pierson and Castenholz 1974a) is a true thermophile, but several other mesophilic, phototrophic types have now been discovered, so that confusion between Herpetosiphon and Chloroflexus is very likely if only partial phenotypic characteristics are used for identification.
Holt and Lewin 1968, 2408.AL
The definition was based on three isolates of E.E.
Jeffers obtained from a slime coat of Chara sp.
(Phylum: Charophyta) from Birch Lake, Minnesota.
Isolated in the immediate vicinity of a hot spring in Baja California.
Additional Remarks: The original description of this species assumed synonymy with Phormidium geysericola Copeland 1936, a presumed cyanobacterium.
The reason for assuming H. geysericola to be the organism that Copeland described was the morphological similarities with field material alone.
The only culture strain of H. geysericola was not from a hot spring at 60–80°C, but from the surroundings of a hot spring.
There is no evidence that it is thermotolerant or thermophilic.
The ATCC lists a growth temperature of 30°C, which is essentially impossible for any bacterium capable of growth at 60°C or higher.
The upper limit for H. geysericola is 38–40°C (see Reichenbach, 1992).
Therefore, the synonym with Phormidium geysericola Copeland should be dropped, since the true identity of Copeland's organism is not known.
A good possibility, however, is that it was a Chloroflexus sp.
that has very similar morphological properties.
Chloroflexus is well known from hot springs in the range of 60 to ~70°C (see above).

Type species: Hirschia baltica Schlesner, Bartels, Sittig, Dorsch and Stackebrandt 1990, 449.
Number of validated species: 1
Cells of Hirschia spp.
are morphologically very similar to members of the genera Hyphomicrobium and Hyphomonas (Figure 1).
Even the life cycle resembles that of the above genera, i.e., a motile swarmer cell loses the flagellum, the cell produces a hypha at one pole and a bud is formed at the tip of the hypha.
A flagellum is produced at the distal pole of the bud.
The mature bud separates from the mother cell by fission of the hyphal tip.
Additional daughter cells may be produced by the mother cell.
Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the type strain indicated that the genus Hirschia is a member of the Alphaproteobacteria and is distinctly but remotely related to members of the genera Hyphomicrobium, Filomicrobium, Pedomicrobium, and Dichotomicrobium.
The 23S rRNA is not nicked (Schlesner et al., 1990).

Number of validated species: 5
The species listed under “Other Organisms” have not been validly published.
They show the typical features of the genus, namely the expression of a life cycle with infectious and reproductive forms and a strong infectivity for the host nuclei.
They share a number of biological features with the validated Holospora species and are therefore listed in this chapter.
Except for “H.
recta”, where this has been questioned (see below), the bacteria appear to be good species with a distinct host specificity, nucleus-specificity, and clear morphology.

Recent observations may cast some doubt upon the inclusion of H. caryophila in the genus Holospora.
It was observed that the behavior of H. caryophila in dividing host nuclei is different from that of H. undulata, H. elegans, H. obtusa, and “H.
acuminata”.
While in those species the infectious forms are collected in the connecting piece of the dividing nucleus and are then released from the nucleus, infectious forms of H. caryophila leave the host nucleus by an unknown mode (Fokin et al., 1996).
Moreover, in contrast to H. undulata, H. elegans, and H. obtusa, H. caryophila is not recognized by the Holospora probe in in situ hybridization (“H.
acuminata” not tested; Fokin et al., 1996).
Because of these differences to H. undulata, H. obtusa, and H. elegans, H. caryophila has been considered to belong to a second group of Holospora (Table 1).
Additional Remarks: The type strain of H. caryophila is in stock 562 of P. tetraurelia (ATCC 30694) (Preer et al., 1974).
(ex Hafkine 1890) Preer and Preer 1982, 141VP

The question may finally be resolved after molecular data have been obtained from the different strains.

Number of validated species: 1
This organism differs substantially from the Cystobacter species discussed above and is therefore classified in a new genus.
The distinguishing characteristics are as follows.
The vegetative cells are shorter and more delicate than those of Cystobacter species.
The sporangioles are small and often empty and glassy.
They are arranged in monolayer sheets or in short chains and do not pile up, or do so only slightly.
The swarm colonies have a delicate slime sheet with very fine veins.
The only species known so far somewhat resembles Cystobacter disciformis, although the latter has much different fruiting bodies.
In addition, some traits are like those of Polyangium minus (now Cystobacter) in the original description of Krzemieniewska and Krzemieniewski (1926).
The identity of Hyalangium with that organism cannot be ruled out with certainty, but even if the two organisms should be the same, a reclassification would be required.
Hyalangium minutum is found in the usual myxobacterial habitats; it is rather common but easily overlooked because of its inconspicuous, translucent fruiting bodies and often complete degeneration of fruiting.
The type strain, NOCB-2, was isolated in 1992 from soil with decaying plant material collected by Dr. S. Yamanaka in the mountains of Izu and Manazuru peninsula in Japan.
Reference strain NOCB-4 comes from a sample collected in 1992 in Indianapolis, IN, USA, and was isolated in 1993; reference strain Hy m4 was isolated in 1998 from soil with rotting wood collected in 1997 in Iowa City, IA, USA.
As mentioned above, it cannot be ruled out that the species is identical with Polyangium minus (now Cystobacter) Krzemieniewska and Krzemieniewski 1926.
The 16S rRNA sequences of the type strain and of a second isolate, NOCB-4, cluster closely together and are well separated from Cystobacter species.
The most closely related sequences are those of Stigmatella (Spröer et al., 1999).

Type species: Ilyobacter polytropus Stieb and Schink 1985, 375VP (Effective publication: Stieb and Schink 1984, 145.
Number of validated species: 3
The taxonomic status of Ilyobacter delafieldii is unclear.
Since it stains Gram-negative and resembles Ilyobacter polytropus in many of its metabolic capacities, it was originally assigned to the genus Ilyobacter.
However, sequence analysis of its 16S rRNA gene later revealed that it should be grouped within the genus Clostridium (Janssen, unpublished), even though spore formation could not be demonstrated (Janssen and Harfoot, 1990).
The cell-wall architecture of Ilyobacter delafieldii strain 10cr1 (Janssen and Harfoot, 1990) is not typical of Gram-stain-negative bacteria but resembles that of a Gram-stain-positive bacterium with a complex cell-wall structure.
For this reason, we do not include Ilyobacter delafieldii any further in this genus.
Ilyobacter tartaricus has generated major interest because of its Na+-translocating ATP-synthase system.
Tartrate and oxaloacetate are metabolized via pyruvate; the oxaloacetate decarboxylase is a Na+-translocating, membrane-bound enzyme.
The Na+-gradient established this way is used for ATP-synthesis via a membrane-bound Na+-translocating ATP-synthase enzyme, and contributes to the overall energy balance of the cell.
Together with a similar enzyme in Propionigenium modestum (Hilpert et al., 1984), this Na+-ATPase has become one of the model systems to study the architecture of this type of F1F0-ATPases and especially the linkage between Na+-ion transport and ATP synthesis (Neumann et al., 1998).
The three-dimensional structure of this Na+-ATPase was recently resolved in detail (Meier et al., 2005).
The study of Na+-translocating ATPases has also contributed significantly to a better understanding of proton transport in the more common H+-translocating F1F0-ATPases (Gemperli et al., 2003).
After two to three transfers, the bacteria can be isolated in anoxic agar deep dilution series (Pfennig, 1978) or in roll tubes (Balch et al., 1979).
Streaking on Petri dishes in an anoxic glove box has not yet been tried with these bacteria.
Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis places the members of the genera Propionigenium and Ilyobacter (with the exception of Ilyobacter delafieldii) into the Fusobacteria phylum (Brune et al., 2002).
Both genera form a distinct cluster, clearly separated from the Sebaldella–Streptobacillus–Leptotrichia lineage and the Fusobacterium branch.
While the 16S rRNA gene sequences did not allow resolving the branching order within the Ilyobacter–Propionigenium cluster, the 23S rRNA gene sequences supported a monophyletic status at least for the genus Ilyobacter (Brune et al., 2002).
Although the metabolic properties of Propionigenium and Ilyobacter species are sufficiently different to justify maintenance of two separate genera, the situation is unsatisfying and asks for a future taxonomic revision of this group.

Number of validated species: 1
A study of the regulation mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids has shown that 3-deoxy-d-arabinoheptulonate-7-phosphate synthetase is inhibited by tryptophan, chorismate, prephenate, phenylalanine, and tyrosine.
Co2+ is needed for maximum activity.
Prephenate-dehydrogenase is NAD+-specific and is not inhibited by tyrosine (Whitaker et al., 1981; Byng et al., 1983).
Various bacteriophages have been isolated from soil or water near infected vines and are differentiated by the morphology of their plaques on exponentially growing plates of Xylophilus strains.
All strains of Xylophilus are sensitive to phage P X.a.15, which produces plaques that keep expanding over several days with the formation of a halo.
Other phages are specific to certain groups of strains (Ridé, 1996).
The following API test strips were used: AP1-ZYM, Osidases, Esterases, AP1, AP2, and AP3 (Biomérieux, France).
Xylophilus strains are plant pathogens.
They are responsible for bacterial necrosis and canker of grapevine (Vitis vinifera) in the Mediterranean region and South Africa (Panagopoulos, 1969; Erasmus et al., 1974).
Although first described in France in 1895 as “Maladie d' Oléron” (Ravaz, 1895), the causal agent of bacterial necrosis of grapevine was not isolated until 1969 (Panagopoulos, 1969).
The disease becomes apparent in early spring, when buds on affected shoots fail to open.
Longitudinal cracks and cankers appear as they develop from hyperplasiae in the cambial tissue.
Underlying vascular tissue shows a brown discoloration and will eventually die.
Other parts of the plant that may be infected include petioles, flower stalks, and fruit stalks, resulting in death of leaves, flowers, or fruits.
Leaves infected through hydathodes or stomata will show reddish-brown lesions.
Roots can also be affected, resulting in retarded growth of shoots.
Severity of symptoms may vary considerably for different varieties of grapevine (Panagopoulos, 1969; Grasso et al., 1979; Ridé, 1984, 1996; López et al., 1987).
From being a rather rare disease at the beginning of the 20th century, it has now become more significant in the Mediterranean area through a combination of factors such as favorable environmental conditions, pruning procedures, and the increased mechanization of various viticultural practices (Ridé, 1996).
An in vitro test to assess cultivar susceptibility has been described by Peros et al.
(1995).
It involves inoculation of 2-month-old plantlets (having 8–12 internodes) by decapitation with scissors dipped in a bacterial suspension.
After several weeks of incubation, the number of internodes with symptoms is recorded as an estimate for the progression of infection.
(Panagopoulos 1969) Willems, Gillis, Kersters, Van Den Broecke, and De Ley 1987, 428VP (Xanthomonas ampelina Panagopoulos 1969, 75.)
Isolated from Vitis vinifera, where it causes bacterial necrosis and canker, in the Mediterranean area and South Africa.
Similar symptoms on grape vine have been reported from Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, the Canary Islands, and Switzerland (Bradbury, 1973).
Anne Willems is indebted to the Fund for Scientific Research–Flanders for a position as postdoctoral research fellow.

Type species: Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus Jagoueix, Bové and Garnier 1994, 385 (Candidatus Liberobacter asiaticum (sic) Jagoueix, Bové and Garnier 1994, 385.)
Number of validated species: 2
Candidatus Liberibacter spp.
are phytopathogenic bacteria affecting most, if not all, Citrus species and some other genera and species in the Rutaceae family.
They are responsible for huanglongbing (ex.
greening disease).
Natural infections are limited to members of the Rutaceae plant family, but experimental transmissions by dodder (Cuscuta sp.)
to periwinkle (Catharanthus roseus, Apocynaceae) and tobacco (Nicotiana sp., Solanaceae) have been achieved (Garnier and Bové, 1983; Bové and Garnier, 1992).
Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus is present in Asia (from Pakistan to China) and induces symptoms in a temperature range of 25–40°C, while Candidatus Liberibacter africanus is present in South and Eastern Africa as well as Cameroon and does not induce symptoms when temperatures are above 30°C (Bové et al., 1974; Garnier and Bové, 1996).
Psyllids become contaminated by feeding on infected plants; they remain infective all their life.
Candidatus Liberibacter cells can cross the insect gut membranes and multiply into the hemolymph, from which they reach salivary glands.
From there on, they can be reinoculated into plants.
There is no evidence of transovarial transmission of the liberibacteria.
Two psyllids, Diaphorina citri in Asia (Capoor et al., 1967) and Trioza erytreae in Africa (McLean and Oberholzer, 1965), are vectors of the liberibacteria.
Diaphorina citri has also been present in South and Central America for many years; it has recently reached Florida and the West Indies.
Liberibacteria, however, are not present in the American continent and the West Indies.
Recently D. citri has also been reported from Iran.
In the Arabian Peninsula (South Western Saudi Arabia, Yemen), Mauritius, and Reunion islands, both psyllid vectors and the two Candidatus Liberibacter spp.
are present (Garnier and Bové, 1996).
To date, all attempts to grow liberibacteria in axenic cultures have failed.
Cells belonging to Candidatus Liberibacter can be identified by amplification and sequencing of the 16S rDNA.
The complete sequence of the 16S rRNA gene is deposited in GenBank under the accession number L22532 for Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and L22533 for Candidatus Liberibacter africanus.
Primers for specific amplification of the Candidatus Liberibacter 16S rDNA have been developed and yield a 1160 bp amplicon with both species (Jagoueix et al., 1996).
The oligonucleotide sequences complementary to unique regions of the 16S rDNA are 5′-GCGCGTATGCAATACGAGCGGCA-3′ for Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and 5′-GCGCGTATTTTATACGAGCGGCA-3′ for Candidatus Liberibacter africanus.
Digestion of the amplified DNA with XbaI is required for species identification.
Primers A2 (5′-TATAAAGGTTGACCTTTCGAGTTT-3′) and J5 (5′-ACAAAAGCAGAAATAGCACGAACAA-3′) defined in the ribosomal protein genes rplA and rplJ of the Candidatus Liberibacter spp.
yield amplicons of 703 bp and 669 bp for Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus and Candidatus Liberibacter africanus, respectively (Hocquellet et al., 1999).

Type species: Marinococcus halophilus Hao, Kocur and Komagata 1985, 535VP (Effective publication: Hao, Kocur and Komagata 1984, 456.)
(Planococcus halophilus Novitsky and Kushner 1976.
Number of validated species: 3
The ability of Marinococcus halophilus and Marinococcus albus to precipitate carbonates has been studied in several strains isolated from the Salar de Atacama (Chile).
The bioliths precipitated were spherical and varied with the salinity; they were of magnesium calcite, with Mg content increasing with increasing salinity (Rivadeneyra et al., 1999).
Several plasmids have been detected in Marinococcus halophilus; the complete nucleotide sequence (3874 bp) of one of these plasmids, designated pPL1, has been determined.
Plasmids have not been detected in Marinococcus albus (Louis and Galinski, 1997a).
The species of the genus Marinococcus are moderately halophilic, which are defined as those micro-organisms that grow optimally in media with 3–15% NaCl.
To grow over a wide range of salt concentrations, moderately halophilic bacteria accumulate organic osmotic solutes (Ventosa et al., 1998).
In the species of the genus Marinococcus the main osmotic solutes are ectoine and hydroxyectoine (Ventosa et al., 1998).
The genes responsible for the synthesis of the compatible solute ectoine have been identified and sequenced.
The three genes (ectA, ectB, and ectC) of the biosynthetic pathway of ectoine were cloned by functional expression in Escherichia coli; these genes were not only expressed, but also osmo-regulated in Escherichia coli (Louis and Galinski, 1997b).
A stress-inducible promoter region from Marinococcus halophilus has been investigated upstream of the ectA gene, using the green fluorescent protein as a reporter molecule (Bestvater and Galinski, 2002).
Marinococcus halophilus does not entirely rely on ectoine synthesis for osmoadaption, and similarly to other halophilic bacteria, it can also take up compatible solutes from the external medium.
To allow for the uptake of external solutes, Marinococcus halophilus is equipped with osmoregulated transport systems, similarly to nonhalophilic bacteria; two transporters for compatible solutes belonging to the betaine-carnitine-choline transporter family have been reported for Marinococcus halophilus (Vermeulen and Kunte, 2004).
Two structural genes encoding a betaine transporter named BetM, which also accepts ectoine as an additional substrate, and a transport system specific for the uptake of ectoines named EctM have been identified and characterized (Vermeulen and Kunte, 2004).
The protein stabilization by several naturally occurring osmolytes has been investigated.
Knapp et al.
(1999) showed that the osmolyte hydroxyectoine purified from Marinococcus is a very efficient stabilizer and they suggest that this compatible solute could be an interesting stabilizer in biotechnological processes in which enzymes are applied in the presence of denaturants or at high temperature.

The organism was isolated from the blood of an immunocompromised patient suffering from meningoencephalitis.
The infection was viewed as opportunistic because the 16S rDNA sequence obtained from the organism was most similar to those of the soil microorganisms Telluria mixta, Telluria chitinolytica, and Duganella zoogloeoides, which are not known to be pathogenic to humans.
Other characteristics, including biochemical test profiles and mol% G + C of the DNA, were consistent with this relationship.

Number of validated species: 4
Symbols: +, property of the species; −, not a property of the species; nd, not determined.
The methanocaldococci have not been reported to be associated with disease.
Methanocaldococci have been isolated from chimney material and sediments from deep-sea hydrothermal vents in both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
Methanocaldococcus is distinguished from the mesophile Methanococcus and the thermophile Methanothermococcus by its hyperthermophily.
It is distinguished from the other hyperthermophilic coccus, Methanotorris, by its growth requirement for selenium, the presence of flagellar tufts, and its 16S rRNA sequence.
Restriction fragment length polymorphism of the gene encoding the 16S rRNA has proven useful for distinguishing species of Methanocaldococcus from each other as well as from strains of Methanotorris (Jeanthon et al., 1999a).
It is difficult to distinguish species of Methanocaldococcus on phenotypic properties alone.
Of the four species currently described, only M. fervens is resistant to rifampicin, and only M. jannaschii is not stimulated by yeast extract.

Type species: Methanofollis tationis (Zabel, König and Winter 1984) Zellner, Boone, Keswani, Whitman, Woese, Hagelstein, Tindall and Stackebrandt 1999, 253 (Methanogenium tatii Zabel, König and Winter 1984, 313).
Number of validated species: 2
The original description was supplemented with material on the utilization of secondary and cyclic alcohols from Zellner and Winter (1987b) and Bleicher et al.
(1989).
Methanofollis liminatans contains a secondary alcohol dehydrogenase (sADH) activity which is devoid of zinc and dependent on factor F420 (Bleicher and Winter, 1991), while on the other hand, the sADH of Methanobacterium palustre is dependent on NADP+ (Bleicher and Winter, 1991).
The pterin of Methanofollis tationis has a structural modification not found in other methanogens and is called tatiopterin.
Tatiopterin is lacking a 7-methyl substituent but has both a glutamyl and an aspartyl residue conjugated to the phosphoglutaryl moiety (Raemakers-Franken et al., 1989) and can be distinguished from methanopterin and sarcinapterin.
Methanopterin [7-methylpterin (2-amino-4-hydroxy-7-methylpteridine)] is detected in Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus and Methanolobus tindarius (Keltjens et al., 1983, DiMarco et al., 1990), while sarcinapterin, a methanopterin derivative containing an additional glutamyl moiety conjugated to the α-carboxylate of the α-hydroxyglutarate, is detected in Methanosarcina spp.
and Methanococcus voltae.
Methanofollis liminatans is antigenically unrelated to other methanogenic reference strains, including Methanogenium cariaci JR1, Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1, Methanoplanus limicola M3, and Methanomicrobium mobile BP (Zellner et al., 1990c).
Analyses of 16S rRNA and 16S rDNA sequences demonstrated the phylogenetic relationship of Methanofollis tationis strain DSMZ 2702, Methanofollis liminatans strains GKZPZ and BM1 to other members of the family Methanomicrobiaceae.
The three species form a phylogenetically coherent genus almost equidistant from Methanoculleus and Methanogenium (Figure 1)
M. tationis was isolated by agar plating and picking a well separated colony.
Growth in closed vessels is improved if the atmosphere is pressurized to 300 kPa or if the gas phase is periodically flushed with the appropriate gas mixture.
The cells could not be distinguished from those species of Methanogenium, Methanoculleus, Methanoplanus, Methanolacinia, and Methanocorpusculum on the basis of substrate spectrum (Table 1).
The mol% G + C of Methanofollis tationis is similar to the mol% G + C of Methanoculleus olentangyi and Methanoculleus thermophilicus TCI; the mol% G + C of Methanofollis liminatans is similar to that of Methanoculleus marisnigri, Methanoculleus thermophilicus strains, and Methanoculleus palmolei (Zellner et al., 1998).
The mol% G + C of both Methanofollis species is clearly distinct from that of Methanogenium, Methanoplanus, Methanolacinia, and Methanomicrobium species (Table 1).
Antigenic fingerprinting of Methanofollis liminatans GKZPZ demonstrated that it is antigenically unrelated to other methanogenic reference strains, including Methanogenium cariaci JR1, Methanoculleus marisnigri JR1, Methanoplanus limicola M3, and Methanomicrobium mobile BP of the family Methanomicrobiaceae (Zellner et al., 1990c).

Type species: Methanolinea tarda Imachi Sakai Sekiguchi Hanada Kamagata Ohashi and Harada 2008, 299PV.
Number of validated species: 2.
Family classification: The genus Methanolinea is classified within the family METHANOREGULACEAE.
The genome sequence has been determined for M. tarda (Yamamoto et al., 2014) but not yet for M. mesophila.
M. tarda has a circular chromosome of 2,052,856 bp length containing 1,634 candidate genes (77.5% of the total open reading frames).
The genome contains 2,057 protein-coding sequences, 55 pseudogenes, 46 tRNA genes, and an rRNA operon including one 16S rRNA small-subunit gene and one 23S large-subunit gene.
No 5S rRNA gene was found in the genome.
Consistent with its growth on H2/CO2 and formate, the M. tarda genome contains all of genes considered necessary hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis and formate dehydrogenase.
Moreover, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) locus and 9 CRISPR-associated genes, and 16 transposases and inactivated derivatives are also present.
This finding suggests that viral predation and gene transfer events by mobile genetic elements contribute to the evolution of M. tarda.
Further comparison of M. mesophila and Methanolinea-related genomes (Lykidis et al., 2011; Nobu et al., 2015) will provide insights into the unique genetic and physiological characteristics of the members of the genus Methanolinea.
Methanolinea species are further compared with other members of the family METHANOREGULACEAE.

Methanoplanus belongs to the family Methanomicrobiaceae on the basis of the utilization of H2/CO2 or formate as an energy source, the relatively high G + C content of the DNA, and the lack of a rigid cell wall.
The requirement for acetate in combination with the inability to use acetate, methanol, and methylamines as energy sources is a further characteristic of this group.
Methanoplanus differs from the other genera of the Methanomicrobiaceae by the flat cell shape and the existence of flagella.
16S rRNA data demonstrate that members of the genera Methanogenium and Methanomicrobium are the closest relatives (Ollivier et al., 1997; Huber and Stetter, in press.1).
Initial 16S rRNA–DNA hybridization experiments indicated that Methanoplanus should be placed as a separate family, the Methanoplanaceae, within the order Methanomicrobiales (Tu et al., 1982).
However, later 16S rRNA sequence comparisons indicated that Methanoplanus species are closely related to members of the genera Methanomicrobium, Methanogenium, and Methanoculleus, which all belong to the family Methanomicrobiaceae (Boone et al., 1993b; Ollivier et al., 1997; Huber and Stetter, in press1).
Therefore, the genus Methanoplanus should be placed within this family and the family Methanoplanaceae should no longer be recognized.
Differential characteristics of the speicies of the genus Methanoplanus are indicated in Table 1.

The generic description is based on that of the type species, Methanosalsum zhilinae (Methanohalophilus zhilinae Mathrani, Boone, Mah, Fox and Lau, 1988, 141).
Additional material supplied by Kevbrin et al.
(1997).
Type species: Methanosalsum zhilinae comb.
nov. (Methanohalophilus zhilinae Mathrani, Boone, Mah, Fox and Lau 1988, 141).
Number of validated species: 1
The genus Methanosalsum can be separated from genera outside the family Methanosarcinaceae by the ability to grow by catabolism of methylamines with the formation of methane.
The only methylotrophic methanogen outside Methanosarcinaceae is Methanosphaera, which differs from Methanosalsum by growing only by catabolism of methanol plus H2.
Methanosalsum can be distinguished from most other species of Methanosarcinaceae by its environmental requirements of salinity and pH.
Methanosalsum is moderately halophilic, whereas Methanohalobium is extremely halophilic and Methanosarcina is halotolerant (Table 1).
The salinity requirement of Methanosalsum is similar to those of Methanohalophilus, Methanococcoides, and Methanolobus, but these genera generally grow at much lower pH values than does Methanosalsum.
Methanosalsum is most similar in its environmental requirements of pH and salinity to Methanolobus oregonensis.
M. oregonensis has a lower temperature optimum (35–37°C) and a lower maximum salinity (1.7 M Na+) than Methanosalsum (45°C and 2 M Na+).
Further, M. oregonensis (but not Methanosalsum) requires thiamin as a growth substrate.

Type species: Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus comb.
nov. (Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus Huber, Thomm, König, Thies and Stetter 1982, 50).
Number of validated species: 1
Symbols: +, property of the species; −, not a property of the species.
Like other methanogens, methanothermococci are generally resistant to low concentrations of many common antibiotics.
Organotin compounds including phenyltin, tripropyltin, and triethyltin are inhibitory at low concentrations (IC50 = 5 μM; Boopathy and Daniels, 1991).
The methanothermococci have not been reported to be associated with disease.
Methanothermococcus is distinguished from the mesophiles Methanococcus and the hyperthermophiles Methanocaldococcus and Methanotorris by its moderate thermophily.
It differs from most other moderately thermophilic methanogens (such as Methanothermobacter) by its coccoid morphology.
So far, Methanoculleus thermophilicus is the only other moderately thermophilic coccus described (Rivard and Smith, 1982; Ferguson and Mah, 1983).
M. thermophilicus requires acetate for growth, grows in low concentrations of NaCl, has a mol% G + C of 56–60, and is easily distinguishable by these properties.
Antigenic cross-reactivity (Conway de Macario et al., 1981; Bryniok and Trosch, 1989; Nilsen and Torsvik, 1996), 16S rRNA sequencing (Keswani et al., 1996), and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) of cellular proteins (Nilsen and Torsvik, 1996) are also helpful for final identification of new isolates.

Type species: Methylocapsa acidiphila Dedysh, Khmelenina, Suzina, Trotsenko, Semrau, Liesack, Tiedje 2002, 260VP.
Number of species with validated names: 3.
Figure 2.

(b) Electron micrograph of an ultrathin section of a methane-grown cell.

Bars, 5 µm (a) and 0.5 µm (b).
All members of the genus Methylocapsa possess a well-developed system of intracytoplasmic membranes (ICM), which can be revealed in thin sections of the cells (Figures 1b and 2b).
Extended layers of membrane vesicles are packed in parallel to each other on only one side of the cell membrane.
This pattern of ICM arrangement is different from both type I ICM arrangement (stacks of vesicles) in gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs and type II ICM arrangement (peripherally and loosely arranged membranes aligned parallel to cytoplasmic membrane) in alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs of the genera Methylosinus and Methylocystis.
The membrane pattern in Methylocapsa was therefore classified as a type III of ICM arrangement in methanotrophic bacteria (Dedysh et al., 2002).
The above-described complex membrane system is absent from cyst-like cells in old cultures (Figure 1c).
These cells are surrounded by an additional two-layered envelope or coat and are most similar to the cysts formed by members of the genus Azotobacter.
Representatives of the genus Methylocapsa are typical inhabitants of acidic wetlands and soils (Dedysh et al., 2003; Dedysh, 2009).
Three described species of the genus Methylocapsa were isolated from a boreal Sphagnum-Carex peat bog, acidic forest soil, and a collapsed palsa soil (Dedysh et al., 2002; Dunfield et al., 2010; Dedysh et al., 2015).
Methylocapsa-related transcripts of pmoA and nifH genes encoding pMMO and dinitrogenase reductase, respectively, were detected in a subarctic palsa peatland (Liebner and Svenning, 2013).
In addition, Methylocapsa-related MxaF fragments (large subunit of methanol dehydrogenase) were retrieved from an acidic forest soil in a course of a study on active methylotrophs identified by means of stable isotope probing (Radajewski et al., 2002).
These findings suggest that members of the genus Methylocapsa are metabolically active in various acidic terrestrial environments.
Cells of Methylocapsa-like methanotrophs can be recognized in enrichment cultures or among other methanotrophs using phase-contrast microscopy.
Due to the presence of intracytoplasmic membrane vesicles on only one side of the cell membrane, cells of Methylocapsa look somewhat darker on one side.
Procedures for verifying methanotrophic activity, and distinguishing between obligate and facultative methanotrophy, are described in detail by Dedysh and Dunfield 2011.
A specific feature of all Methylocapsa species is possession of a divergent pmoA gene encoding the active-site polypeptide of pMMO.
The inferred peptide sequences of pmoA from Methylocapsa species form a PmoA lineage (Figure 3), which is only distantly related to the PmoA sequence cluster of alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs of the genera Methylosinus and Methylocystis, with identity values between 69% and 72%.
The identity values between the PmoA of Methylocapsa species and PmoA sequences of gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs range from 55% to 68%.
Partial fragments of the pmoA gene can be amplified from DNA of tested strains using primers and reaction conditions described by Holmes et al.
1995 and compared to those of Methylocapsa species and other proteobacterial methanotrophs.
The ability to grow on methane clearly differentiates Methylocapsa from nonmethanotrophic members of the family Beijerinckiaceae, i.e., the genera Beijerinckia, Methylovirgula, and Methylorosula.
Characteristics that distinguish Methylocapsa from other methanotrophs of the family Beijerinckiaceae are listed in Table 2.
The presence of intracytoplasmic membranes and pMMO, absence of sMMO, and the preference for growth on methane are the key features that differentiate Methylocapsa from the genera Methylocella and Methyloferula.
In addition, cells of Methylocapsa species are usually thicker than those of Methylocella and Methyloferula and do not form rosettes as those of Methyloferula stellata.
The closest phylogenetic neighbors of Methylocapsa are sMMO-possessing facultative methanotrophs of the genus Methylocella (96.5–97.5% sequence similarity), sMMO-possessing obligate methanotrophs of the genus Methyloferula (96.0–96.5%), heterotrophs of the genus Beijerinckia (96.5–97.7%), and facultative methylotrophs of the genera Methylovirgula (96.3–97.0%) and Methylorosula (96.0%) (Figure 4).
All these currently recognized members of the family Beijerinckiaceae are very close to each other phylogenetically but are distinct phenotypically.
Taxonomic construction based on 21 concatenated methylotrophy proteins also confirms the close phylogenetic relationship of Methylocapsa to Methyloferula and Methylocella (Tamas et al., 2014).
Yet, Methylocapsa remains the only genus accommodating pMMO-containing methanotrophs in the family Beijerinckiaceae.

Type species: Methylorosula polaris Berestovskaya, Kotsyurbenko, Tourova, Kolganova, Doronina, Golyshin and Vasilyeva 2012, 644VP.
Number of validated species: 1.
Three strains of M. polaris were isolated from acidic tundra wetland soil near the city of Vorkuta and from the Chukotka and Yugorsky peninsulas indicating a widespread distribution of representatives of this genus in the northern regions of Russia.
Methylotrophs of the genus Methylorosula can clearly be differentiated from members of the genera Methylocapsa (Dedysh et al., 2002), Methylocella (Dedysh et al., 2000, 2004), and Methyloferula (Vorobev et al., 2011) by the inability to grow on methane.
Characteristics that distinguish Methylorosula from other nonmethanotrophic methylotrophs of the family Beijerinckiaceae are listed in Table 1.
Bacteria of the genus Methylorosula reproduce by irregular fission and are motile by means of a subpolar flagellum.
They do not fix atmospheric nitrogen as characteristic for all other currently described members of the family Beijerinckiaceae.
In contrast to Beijerinckia mobilis (Dedysh et al., 2005) and Methylovirgula ligni (Vorob'ev et al., 2009), Methylorosula does not utilize organic acids but is able to use methylated amines and amino acids.
The DNA G + C content of Methylorosula is higher than that of other representatives of the family Beijerinckiaceae.

Number of validated species: 1
Although Micavibrio has some characteristics that resemble those of the genus Bdellovibrio, it has several distinctive differences from this genus that warrant a separate taxonomic classification.
Morphologically, bdellovibrios and micavibrios are similar in size and shape, but Micavibrio cells have a single unsheathed polar flagellum (Lambina et al., 1982).
The flagellum of the Bdellovibrio sp.
has a definite sheath, as shown by electron microscopy studies.
Both genera are parasitic in nature; however, members of Micavibrio are exoparasites, while bdellovibrios are endoparasites.
Prey specificity of Micavibrio species also appears to be much more narrow than the range observed for Bdellovibrio sp.
Micavibrio species also demonstrate morphological similarities to the Chlorella parasite, Vampirovibrio chlorellavorus (previously described as Bdellovibrio chlorellavorus).
Both are exoparasites and are characterized by a high specificity with respect to their individual prey.
However, Micavibrio spp.
demonstrate an ability to lyse procaryotic bacterial cells while the chlorellavorus bacterium exclusively parasitizes eucaryotic algae (Lambina et al., 1982).

Myroides odoratus is most commonly recovered from human urine specimens, sometimes in significant numbers, and from colonization of amputation sites (Davis et al., 1979; Holmes et al., 1979; Vancanneyt et al., 1996).
Strains of Myroides odoratimimus have been isolated from human wounds, urine, human leg slough, pus, and a water sample (Vancanneyt et al., 1996).
The role of Myroides odoratus and Myroides odoratimimus as causative agents of infection is ill-defined and data are still emerging.
Yağci et al.
(2000) reported an outbreak of Myroides odoratimimus that occurred in a urology ward of a hospital over a 3-year period and described the use of DNA fingerprinting for characterization of the isolates.
Green et al.
(2001) reported a case of bacteremia and recurrent cellulitis caused by Myroides odoratus in an evidently immunocompetent male; this appears to be the first documented life-threatening infection in an immunocompetent host.
Motwani et al.
(2004) reported a case of cellulitis caused by Myroides odoratus that progressed to septic shock.
Special procedures are not normally required for the isolation of Myroides odoratus and Myroides odoratimimus.
Myroides pelagicus was isolated from seawater and can be cultured in marine broth 2216 (Difco).
Yoon et al.
(2006a) reported that the type strain of Myroides pelagicus shared 93–95% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with the type strains of Myroides odoratus and Myroides odoratimimus.
Moreover, the DNA–DNA relatedness values of the strain with the type strains of Myroides odoratus and Myroides odoratimimus were less than 70%, indicating that the strain belonged to a novel species.

See under Halobacteriales and the genus Halobacterium.
Recently a variety of extreme halophiles were isolated from hypersaline ponds in Northern China by a group led by P. Zhou in Beijing.
Some neutrophilic strains, OF8 and QX1, have been suggested to belong to the genus Natrialba based on the presence of have the glycolipid S2-DGD-1 (M. Kamekura, T. Ito and P. Zhou, unpublished data).
The haloalkaliphilic strains “Natronobacterium wudunaoensis” Y21, “Natronobacterium innermongoliae” HAM-2, and “Natronobacterium chahannaoensis” C112 have also been isolated (Y. Xu, P. Zhou and D. Wang, personal communication).
These strains might belong to the genus Natrialba as judged from the 16S rDNA phylogenetic tree reconstruction (Figure 1) and the fact that they share the signature base specific for this genus (Table 1 of the overview).
The GenBank/ EMBL/DDBJ accession numbers of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the last three strains are: AJ001376, AF009601, and AJ004806, respectively.
Strain 98NT4 isolated from Lake Natron, which straddles the Kenyan-Tanzanian border (Duckworth et al., 1996), is also a member of the genus Natrialba.
(The GenBank/EMBL/ DDBJ accession number of the 16S rRNA gene sequence is X92174.)

Members of the genus Natronobacterium have been isolated only from the solar salt pans at Lake Magadi (Tindall, 1980; Tindall et al., 1984a).
There are no reports that members of this genus occur in other alkaline, highly saline environments.
The method of isolation employed a medium containing high levels of NaCl, and low levels of magnesium and calcium, together with sufficient Na2CO3 to maintain the pH between 9.0 and 10.0 (Tindall et al., 1984a).
The method of isolation does not appear to be specific for members of this genus, since members of the species Natronomonas pharaonis (basonym: Halobacterium pharaonis, Natronobacterium pharaonis) and Natrialba magadii (basonym: Natronobacterium magadii), together with a large number of uncharacterized alkaliphilic halobacteria were isolated concurrently with Natronobacterium (Tindall, 1980; Tindall et al., 1984a).
Members of the genus Natronobacterium may be maintained on the media of Tindall et al.
(1984a) and Tindall (1985).
Longterm storage of members of this genus is best achieved by drying or by storing in liquid nitrogen as outlined by Tindall (1991).
A critical aspect in the drying of members of this genus is avoiding the prior freezing of the cells.
Methods described as freeze drying result in rapid loss of viability, whereas methods employing some form of liquid drying result in good recovery.

Strain SP1, which showed 96% similarity to DSMZ 2160T in DNA–DNA hybridization, was isolated from a Kenyan soda lake, Lake Magadi, and deposited as NCIMB 2191 (Tindall et al., 1984a).
NCIMB 2191 contains a small amount of disesterterpanyl moiety (C25C25) lipids, whereas DSMZ 2160T does not (Tindall, 1985).
Cell membranes of Natronomonas pharaonis contain two retinal-containing proteins, pharaonis halorhodopsin and pharaonis phoborhodopsin, which have chloride-pumping activity and negative phototactic activity, respectively (Tomioka and Sasabe, 1995).
No bacteriorhodopsin has been detected (Kamekura et al., 1998).

Type species: Nitrospina gracilis Watson and Waterbury 1971, 225.
Number of validated species: 1
The two strains of Nitrospina are peripherally related to the Deltaproteobacteria (family Desulfarculaceae) (Teske et al.
1994), the class in which the genus Nitrospina was first placed.
Since no phototrophic organisms are known so far in this class, it is questionable whether Nitrospina is derived from photosynthetic ancestry.
Additional details and a comparison of the biochemical properties of Nitrospina to those of other nitrite-oxidizing genera can be found in the introductory chapter “Lithoautotrophic Nitrite-Oxidizing Bacteria.” Detailed treatments of the ecology of nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and of the phylogeny of these organisms can be found in the introductory chapter “Nitrifying Bacteria.”

MAbs, monoclonal antibodies.
Nitrospina can be separated from Nitrobacter and Nitrococcus by means of monoclonal antibodies that recognize the key enzyme (Table 2).
Aamand et al.
(1996) developed three monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that recognize the α- and the β-subunit of the NOR of Nitrobacter.
The key enzyme NOR is ubiquitous in nitrite-oxidizing bacteria.
MAb Hyb 153-2 was specific for the α-NOR of Nitrobacter, whereas MAb Hyb 153-1 recognized the β-NOSs of both Nitrobacter and Nitrococcus.
The MAb Hyb 153-3 recognized the β-NOSs of Nitrobacter, Nitrococcus, Nitrospina and Nitrospira (Bartosch et al., 1999).
Thus, the suite of MAbs permits detection of all known nitrite oxidizers and allows discrimination of Nitrobacter and Nitrococcus from Nitrospina and Nitrospira.
The classification of Nitrospina as a distinct genus is based on the unique morphology and ultrastructure of this organism.
16S rRNA sequence analysis confirmed the phylogenetic position of this organism.
However, the phylogenetic affiliation of Nitrospina with the Deltaproteobacteria remains provisional due to the very limited data set (Ludwig, personal communication).
Euclidian distances derived from fatty acid profiles indicated a higher similarity between Nitrospina and Nitrospira than between either genus and the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria of the Proteobacteria (Nitrobacter and Nitrococcus) (Lipski et al., 2001).

Type species: Parachlamydia acanthamoebae Everett, Bush and Andersen 1999, 435VP.
Number of validated species: 1
In addition to being found in free-living amoebae, in the laboratory Parachlamydia acanthamoebae is able to enter and (to a limited degree to) multiply in Vero cells, in human macrophages, pneumocytes, and lung fibroblasts (Casson et al., 2006; Collingro et al., 2005a; Greub et al., 2003d).
In monocyte-derived macrophages, Parachlamydia acanthamoebae trafficked through the endocytic pathway and replicated in a modified vacuole, which was acidic, Lamp-1 positive, and cathepsin negative (Greub et al., 2005).
This is fundamentally different from the Chlamydiaceae, which bypass the endocytic pathway (Dautry-Varsat et al., 2004).
In human macrophages, Parachlamydia acanthamoebae did not induce an oxidative burst or pro-inflammatory cytokine production, but showed a cytopathic effect, most likely due to apoptosis (Greub et al., 2003d, 2005a).
In contrast, no cytopathic effect was observed on pneumocytes and lung fibroblasts, indicating that rather than macrophages, these or similar cell types might represent replicative niches for Parachlamydia acanthamoebae in humans (Casson et al., 2006).
Parachlamydia acanthamoebae, like other chlamydiae, uses an ATP/ADP translocase to thrive as an energy parasite within its host cell (Greub and Raoult, 2003; Schmitz-Esser et al., 2004).
Free-living amoebae are considered the natural hosts of Parachlamydia species, but there is also accumulating evidence for a potential pathogenicity of these bacteria for humans (extensively reviewed by Greub and Raoult, 2002b; Corsaro and Venditti, 2004; Corsaro and Greub, 2006).
“Hall's coccus”, later identified as a Parachlamydia acanthamoebae strain, was one of the first chlamydia-like organisms that has been implicated in human disease.
It was originally found in an Acanthamoeba species isolated from the source of an outbreak of humidifier fever in Vermont, USA.
In a separate study, approximately 1% of patients with pneumonia of undetermined cause showed elevated antibody titers against these bacteria (Birtles et al., 1997).
To date, Parachlamydia species have primarily been associated with respiratory disease including community acquired pneumonia, bronchitis, and aspiration pneumonia, and also with atherosclerosis (Corsaro et al., 2002; Greub et al., 2003a, b, 2006; Marrie et al., 2001).
These studies are purely based on serological (immunofluorescence assays) or molecular evidence (PCR, nested PCR, real-time PCR).
Parachlamydia acanthamoebae has not yet been isolated from a patient, and Frederick's and Relman's revisions of Koch's postulates for sequence-based identification of microbial pathogens have not yet been fulfilled (Fredericks and Relman, 1996).
Considering the slow growth of Parachlamydia acanthamoebae in human macrophages, pneumocytes, and lung fibroblasts compared to the Chlamydiaceae or the intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila (a difference of three orders of magnitude), and taking into account evidence for Parachlamydia acanthamoebae infections in immunocompromised patients (Greub et al., 2003a; Marrie et al., 2001), Parachlamydia acanthamoebae might be an opportunistic respiratory pathogen.
Everett, Bush and Andersen 1999, 435VP
The 16S rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probe Bn9658 (5′-TCCGTTTTCTCCGCCTAC-3′) can be used for the detection of Parachlamydia acanthamoebae by fluorescence in situ hybridization (Amann et al., 1997), but this probe targets also members of the genus Protochlamydia.
Several Parachlamydia acanthamoebae strains have been described (Berg17, Bn9, “Hall's coccus”, OEW1, Seine, UV7) showing nearly identical 16S rRNA gene sequences.
The genome sequence of Parachlamydia acanthamoebae UV7 is currently being determined.

Type species: Paracraurococcus ruber Saitoh, Suzuki and Nishimura 1998, 1046.
Number of validated species: 1
P. ruber is currently the only known representative of the genus Paracraurococcus.
Phylogenetically this species belongs to the Alphaproteobacteria, most closely related to the genera Craurococcus, Roseococcus, Rhodopila, and Acidiphilium.
Paracraurococcus can be differentiated from other genera based on several characteristics.
The presence of Bchl a organized into reaction center and light-harvesting complexes can be shown by absorption spectrum peaks at 802 and 856 nm, respectively.
Light-harvesting complex I, absorbing at 856 nm, is very rarely found among photosynthetic bacteria.
The only known species that contains similar light-harvesting complexes is Roseococcus thiosulfatophilus (Yurkov and Beatty, 1998a).
The presence of Bchl a and the inability to grow under illuminated, anaerobic conditions distinguishes Paracraurococcus from members of the purple nonsulfur bacteria and places it among the obligately aerobic phototrophic bacteria.

Although the species of the genera Chlorobium and Pelodictyon are physiologically and biochemically fairly similar, the possession of gas vacuoles by the latter genus is ecologically rather significant.
The gas-vacuolated Pelodictyon species are buoyant because of their gas vesicles.
Consequently, these species occur predominantly planktonically in sulfide-containing stagnant bodies of water, in which they may exhibit a selective advantage over Chlorobium species.
The maintenance procedures are the same as described for the genus Chlorobium (see page 605).

The Pleurocapsa-group is a provisional assemblage which can loosely be defined as cyanobacteria that undergo repeated binary fissions in many different planes to produce cell aggregates that are diverse in size and form.
They range from smaller or larger cell aggregates of variable compactness to very complex structures, all of which exhibit at the periphery pseudofilamentous appendages of varying length.
Multiple fission occurs in some cells of the aggregates, resulting in baeocytes which may be motile because they lack a fibrous wall layer at the time of release.
For the present, Pleurocapsa is regarded as a “super-genus” or “form-genus”, within which several different genera may eventually be recognized.
Cyanobacteria placed into this assemblage, the “Pleurocapsa-group” of Waterbury and Stanier (1978), comprise a number of seemingly diverse strains.
The diversity in size of cell aggregates and arrangements typical of this group is illustrated by light micrographs of mass cultures of representative strains (Figures 1, 2, and 3).

Two modes of baeocyte enlargement have been recognized by Waterbury and Stanier (1978) and are illustrated in Figs.
3 and 4.
Figure 4 shows the developmental cycle of strain PCC 7319 in a Cooper dish culture.
In this strain (a member of cluster I; Waterbury, 1989), the baeocyte initially enlarges symmetrically, then divides in many irregular planes to produce a complex cell aggregate with prominent pseudofilamentous appendages.
Multiple fission then occurs in some of the cells in the aggregate, resulting in the release of motile baeocytes.
Characteristic growth stages of strain PCC 7516 (cluster II; Waterbury, 1989) are shown in Figure 3.
The baeocyte elongates and enlarges asymmetrically before the onset of binary fission (Figure 3, parts A and B).
Binary fission in irregular planes results in a cell aggregate with pseudofilamentous appendages.
Aggregate formation is followed by multiple fission (Figure 3D) of some of the vegetative cells to form motile baeocytes.

In contrast to Myxosarcina and Chroococcidiopsis, the planes of successive binary fissions that determine the three-dimensional configuration of vegetative cell aggregates may be altered by environmental factors in most strains of the Pleurocapsa-group.
As a result, the range of morphological and developmental variation within individual strains of this group can be extensive, as illustrated by the following examples.
The differences in developmental expression caused by variable growth conditions are illustrated for strain PCC 7322 (Figure 5).
Under photoheterotrophic conditions, cubical cell aggregates that can be confused with those of Myxosarcina are produced (Figure 5B), whereas under photoautotrophic conditions, cell aggregates exhibit pseudofilamentous appendages (Figure 5A) (Waterbury, 1989).

In strain PCC 7319, the addition of sucrose to the mineral growth medium does not change the gross structure of the aggregate.
Instead, the pseudofilamentous extensions, which are uniseriate at their tips when grown photoautotrophically, become multiseriate throughout their entire length when grown photoheterotrophically (Figure 2, A and B) (Waterbury, 1989).
Pleurocapsa, Hyella, and Solentia, three of the principal genera that largely correspond to the Pleurocapsa-group described in the botanical literature, have been distinguished from each other by their growth habits in the natural environment and on the basis of non-axenic cultures (Figure 6, Figure 7).
Members of Pleurocapsa are epiphytes or epiliths, whereas members of Hyella and Solentia are endoliths that penetrate calcareous substrates.
It is generally believed that the ability to penetrate calcareous substrates is an inherent property possessed by some cyanobacteria, and that the mechanism of penetration, while not known, follows a pattern suggestive of chemical dissolution of the substrate.

Schematic presentation of the life cycle of a Solentia (Pleurocapsa-group): An initially motile, gliding baeocyte settles on the carbonate substrate (1), excretes polysaccharide envelope and penetrates into the substrate (2); this cell increases in size, assumes an asymmetric clavate shape, and divides transversally into a larger cell distal, and a smaller cell proximal, to the substrate surface (S); its envelope bursts open at the distal end (3); both cells increase in size but only the distal cell continues to bore, becoming the apical cell of a pseudofilament composed of cup-shaped downward opening envelopes (4); the clavate apical cell continues to divide transversally, while the isodiametric proximal cell changes the plane of division (5); the subapical cell forms its own envelope, slips out of the alignment (6) forming a false branch (R).
While the apical cells (A) continue to bore and divide, the proximal cell undergoes multiple fission, producing and releasing baeocytes (B) at the substrate surface (7).

Several marine strains of the Pleurocapsa-group in the PCC were isolated from mollusc shells or rock chips and could, in principle, have been either epiliths or endoliths.
Except for strain PCC 7516, observed to be endolithic in its natural habitat, the relations of these strains to their natural substrates were not determined at the time of their isolation.
Following purification, several of these strains (PCC 7314, PCC 7319, PCC 7321, PCC 7322, and PCC 7324) were grown on oyster shell chips that were transferred frequently in a liquid growth medium for a period of 2 years (Waterbury and Stanier, 1978; Waterbury, 1989).
All grew profusely on the surface of the oyster shell chips, but none penetrated the surface, indicating that all five strains were epiliths.
Some experiments suggested that penetration of calcareous substrates might depend on the activity of associated acid-producing bacteria.
This hypothesis was tested by isolating acid-producing, aerobic, chemoheterotrophic bacteria from an impure culture of strain PCC 7506 (a Pleurocapsa-group isolate that was later lost; Waterbury, 1989).
One of the strongest acid-producing bacterial isolates was grown for two months on oyster shells to gether with either strain PCC 7440 or PCC 7516 (Pleurocapsa-group clusters I and II, respectively), the latter of which was known to exhibit endolithic growth.
In these two-membered cultures, maintained in a mineral medium and incubated in the light, both strains penetrated the oyster shell chips, whereas controls lacking the acid-producing bacteria (i.e., axenic cultures of either strain) showed no penetration of the substrate.
These results indicate that associated chemoheterotrophic bacteria may play a role in facilitating the penetration of calcareous substrates by members of the Pleurocapsa-group.
Thus, the effects of chemoheterotrophic bacteria on expression of the endolithic habit by cyanobacteria, whether obligate or facultative, limits the utility of endolithy as a major taxonomic character for the differentiation of genera within the Pleurocapsa-group.
Nevertheless, Le Campanion-Alsumard et al.
(1996), using a non-axenic strain of Solentia, claim that no chemoheterotrophic bacteria could be detected anywhere close to the areas of carbonate dissolution.
They remain convinced that the apical cells typical of the latter genus (and presumably of members of Hyella) are capable of carbonate dissolution.
Another example of the variability in morphological expression and the difficulties associated with identifying genera of the Pleurocapsa-group is provided by the following observations on strain PCC 7324.
In several-months-old liquid cultures of this strain, some cells of the population were observed to be embedded in a mass of extracellular material, which had the form of dichotomously branched threads with a diameter slightly less than that of the connected cells (Waterbury, 1989).
Many of the cells associated with this material were widely separated from one another and typically located at the apices of the threads.
Such forms, present only in old and presumably senescent cultures of this strain, are striking because they display the principal diagnostic feature that distinguishes members of the genus Solentia from Pleurocapsa and Hyella (Figure 8) (Golubic et al., 1996; Komárek and Anagnostidis, 1998).

Cyanobacteria that display the general developmental features described for the Pleurocapsa-group are placed in the botanical literature in a variety of genera, including: Pleurocapsa, Hyella, Myxohyella, Radaisia, Radaisiella, Solentia, Hormathonema, and Cyanostylon.
The distinctions between these genera are made on the basis of characteristics not easily determinable with cultures or characteristics that merely reflect physical and biological responses of a given cyanobacterium to the environment.
Waterbury and Stanier (1978) therefore concluded that the characterization of this group was insufficient to permit even generic boundaries to be established for the strains in pure culture.

Analyses were performed by maximum likelihood as described by Wilmotte and Herdman (this volume.)
The relatedness of strains PCC 7312 and strain PCC 7321 may not be very surprising, since the primary phenotypic characteristic that distinguishes Myxosarcina from the Pleurocapsa-group is the regularity of successive planes of binary fission and lack of pseudofilamentous appendages.
Given that within members of the Pleurocapsa-group the degree of pseudofilamentous extensions may vary with growth conditions, it is reasonable to assume that misidentifications could occur if this discriminatory property is not expressed (see also Taxonomic Comments to the genus Myxosarcina).
In contrast, the close relationship between Pleurocapsa-group strain PCC 7516 and Stanieria PCC 7301 is more difficult to understand, since the developmental patterns in these two baeocyte-forming isolates differ extensively, the latter strain being easily distinguished from the former both by its unicellular mode of growth and by reproducing exclusively by multiple fissions.
Consequently, as mentioned before, the definitive setting of boundaries for genera and species among baeocyte-forming cyanobacteria will require many more carefully characterized isolates, and extensive further studies at the genotypic level.

Anaerobic.
Capable of photosynthesis in the presence of hydrogen sulfide, during which they produce and deposit, as an intermediate oxidation product, S0 in the form of globules outside the cells in the medium.
Number of validated species: 2
Ultrastructure of cells is typical of green sulfur bacteria (Gorlenko and Zhilina, 1968).
The cell wall is of the Gram-negative type.
The outer layer of the cell wall in P. aestuarii is assumed to take part in the excretion and holding of S0 near the cell.
The chlorosomes underlie the cytoplasmic membrane and fill the prosthecae (Figure 4).
Gas vacuoles have never been observed.

In P. aestuarii, the cell suspension appears green and the major pigment is BChl c and is located predominantly in the chlorosomes (in vivo absorption maximum: 740–750 nm).
BChl a (in vivo absorption maximum: 805 nm) is present in the reaction centers that are located in the cytoplasmic membrane.
These centers also contain BChl c and unidentified pigment P-665, which appears to be an unknown pheophytin.
Since bacteriopheophytin a was not found in P. aestuarii (as distinct from Chlorobium limicola; Swarthof et al., 1982), P-665 instead of bacteriopheophytin c is assumed to serve as an acceptor in the photoreactions
The salt tolerance of Prosthecochloris strains correlates with their tolerance for sulfide (maximum, up to 8 mM; optimum, 2–3 mM Na2S·9H2O) and their ability to live under high light intensities (up to 1,000 µmol·m−2·s−1), i.e., they are eurysulfidophilic and euryphotophilic (Matheron and Baulaigue, 1972; Puchkova, 1984).
Brown “P.
phaeoasteroidea” are enriched and purified in the same way as described for P. aestuarii.
The genus Prosthecochloris differs morphologically from other genera of green sulfur bacteria.
The presence of short prosthecae with thickened ends and the absence of gas vacuoles differentiate it from the genera Chlorobium, Pelodictyon, and Ancalochloris.
The latter genus also possesses prosthecae, but the cells contain gas vacuoles.
The shape and the number of prosthecae are different in Ancalochloris than in representatives of Prosthecochloris.

Number of validated species: 3
A draft genome sequence is available for the type strain of Psychroflexus torquis ATCC 700755T.
This strain contains a single genome of 4.29 Mbp, contains no extrachromosomal DNA, and has an overall G+C content of 35 mol%.
A total of 3862 predicted open reading frames is present.
The genome includes three rrna operons (coding rRNA subunit genes) and 38 tRNA genes.
The genome has a relatively low gene coding level, only 82%.
This is explained by the unusually heavy infiltration of lateral gene transferred (LGT) genetic elements into the genome, forming a series of “islands” ranging in size from 9 to 142 kb in length.
These genomic islands are demarcated by lower than average coding density and the presence of phage-type integrases, retron-type reverse transcriptases, and various transposase-like insertional elements.
Indeed, more than 200 of these gene types are present in the genome.
Based on annotation data and database comparisons, as much as 25% of the Psychroflexus torquis genome comprises these LGT islands.
Genes coding polyunsaturated fatty acid synthesis genes (pfa operon) (Allen and Bartlett, 2002) and a large exopolysaccharide genetic locus are located on genomic islands, suggesting that LGT elements may have been critical for the acquisition of some of the more unusual traits of this species.
The remainder of the genome contains, at higher coding density, genes conserved amongst the phylum Bacteroidetes that code for central and intermediary metabolism and housekeeping cellular activities.
The Psychroflexus torquis genome has a metabolome comparable to that of other members of the Flavobacteriaceae that have genome sequence data (e.g., Croceibacter atlanticus, Robiginitalea biformata, Polaribacter irgensii and several others), with a preference for the oxidative catabolism of carbohydrates.
Numerous response regulatory genes and transporters are present suggesting that the micro-organism is particularly sensitive to the surrounding environment.
Many genes are present for the import and export of high molecular mass substances, inorganic ions, solutes, and carbohydrates.
Two BetT high affinity choline/glycine betaine/carnitine transporters and eight putative proline:sodium ion symporters are present with possible protective roles, conferring osmotolerance and/or cryotolerance.
Overall, peptide sequences have the greatest similarities with those of the genome of Croceibacter atlanticus, a pelagic member of the Flavobacteriaceae.
The lack of various genes or pathways for synthesis of pantothenic acid and cobalamin, as well as specific receptor proteins for these compounds, indicates that these vitamins are essential nutrients for growth.
This is borne out by the need to supplement defined mineral salts media with yeast extract before any growth of Psychroflexus torquis can be achieved.
Highly similar orthologs to genes found necessary for gliding (gld genes) in Flavobacterium johnsoniae (Braun and McBride, 2005) are present in the Psychroflexus torquis genome.
The bright orange pigment of Psychroflexus torquis colonies is indicative of carotenoid biosynthesis and genes encoding the synthesis of β-carotene and zeaxanthin are present.
The species also appears to be able to synthesize proteorhodopsin (Friedrich et al., 2002) and possesses a blue light receptor gene ortholog, although at this stage it is unknown if light provides an enhancement to the growth of this species.

Type species: Pyrococcus furiosus Fiala and Stetter 1986b, 573 (Effective publication: Fiala and Stetter 1986a, 60.)
Number of validated species: 5
Cells are surrounded by an envelope about 50 nm thick (Figure 1) which can be differentiated into an inner part of high contrast, measuring about 16 nm thick, and a weakly contrasted outer region.
Cells are stained by the periodate-Schiff reagent and are therefore most likely glycoproteins.
Maltose is fermented Pyrococcus furiosus to acetate, alanine, H2, and CO2 (Kengen and Stams, 1994; Schönheit and Schäfer, 1995).
Pyrococcus contains many heat stable enzymes (Leuschner and Antranikian, 1995), including ADP-dependent kinases in glucose fermentation in Pyrococcus furiosus (Kengen et al., 1996) and tungsten-containing aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductases in P. furiosus (Adams and Kletzin, 1996).
The genus Pyrococcus belongs to the Thermococcales by its 16S rRNA sequence (Huber and Stetter, in press2).
It can be distinguished from Thermococcus (Zillig et al., 1983b) by its lower mol% G + C content (10% lower than Thermococcus) and its higher optimum and maximum growth temperatures.
By 16S rRNA sequencing, Pyrococcus is closely related to Thermococcus (Huber and Stetter, in press†).
The total genome of Pyrococcus horikoshii was published recently (Kawarabayasi et al., 1998).
Furthermore the total genome of “Pyrococcus abyssi” and parts of the genome sequence of Pyrococcus furiosus are available from the websites of Genoscope and the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute Center of Marine Biotechnology.3

Type species: Saprospira grandis Gross 1911, 202AL.
Number of validated species: 1
The saprospiras are versatile microbes.
They are not rare; they are nevertheless all too little studied, perhaps because they apparently include no pathogens.
Their characteristic gliding motility can be seen in the film by Reichenbach (1980).
They move on solid surfaces where they can hope to find potentially nutrient substrates or prey bacteria, but how they move is still under investigation (Aizawa, 2005).
The filaments are multicellular, and it is not known how the cells are coordinated to push all in one direction or the other.
What induces filaments to reverse their direction, or to break is unknown.
All saprospiras in culture are colored, due to different kinds of carotenoids (Lewin and Fox, 1963).
Since the organisms are not photosynthetic, the function of the pigments is not known.
Whether saprospiras are phototactic or chemotactic is also not known.
Within the past few years the biological knowledge of Saprospira, and perhaps of other flexibacteria too, has taken on a new twist since the discovery that these microbes are not merely saprophytes, but that some, at least, are in effect predatory.
Certain strains of marine and freshwater Saprospira spp., like other flexibacteria, produce extracellular toxins that can kill diatoms, cyanobacteria, and other microbes, from which essential nutrients (including predominantly amino-acids; Lewin, 1972) can be absorbed (Ashton and Robarts, 1987; Sakata et al., 1991; Sangkhobol and Skerman, 1981).
Some can even catch prey organisms, by a process called ixotrophy, before killing and digesting them (Lewin, 1997).
Their slime, normally used in some way for their gliding motion, serves as a kind of adhesive “fly paper” with a specific affinity for the flagella of prey bacteria, notably some strains of Vibrio.
When these unfortunate microbes are caught, they can be moved to and fro on the Saprospira surface until eventually killed by exotoxins and subjected to enzymic activity, whereby nutrients are liberated to supplement solutes in the medium.
Saprospiras require some or all of the so-called “essential” amino acids that animals do, and presumably for the same reason.
It is unnecessary to biosynthesize essential molecules when one can obtain them ready-made by digesting food proteins.
Many saprospiras are even more like animals, living by predation on other microbes, including diatoms and dinoflagellates as well as bacteria.
In some, the mucilage tracks that they employ for motility have been pre-adapted to be sticky and thereby to catch bacterial prey, notably species of Vibrio, by their flagella (Lewin, 1997).
Then an ixotrophic saprospira can kill the prey by extracellular toxins and digest them by extracellular enzymes, thereby liberating the amino acids that are needed for growth.
The natures of the sticky mucilage, and of those toxins and enzymes, need to be further studied.
The first marine lytic bacteriophage was found in a saprospira (Lewin et al., 1964), but not all saprospiras succumb to it.
Some saprospiras, perhaps all, contain rhapidosomes, which look like long bacteriophage tails (Reichle and Lewin, 1968).
These are hollow cylinders with protruding central axes, and are liberated in large numbers when the saprospira cells lyse.
Their origin and functions are unknown.
The problems involved in the taxonomy of Saprospira are like those now facing us for almost all microbes and many other kinds of organisms.
We have somehow to resolve disagreements between classifications based solely on visual, biochemical, and physiological characters and those based essentially on molecular biology (MB) data.
Since we as humans are primarily seeing organisms, we have no difficulty in recognizing a giraffe and assigning it to a genus.
So when we look down a microscope and see helical bacteria, we naturally would like to assign them in the same way to named genera.
However, whereas the shapes and sizes of giraffes are controlled by many thousands of genes, and their generations are many years long, those of microbes, with generations some ten orders of magnitude shorter, are controlled by only a handful of genes, and even these tend to be mutable.
Natural selection may induce a filamentous bacterium to mutate and persist as a helix; conversely, a helical bacterium in culture may straighten spontaneously.
Then what price is helicity as a key determinant for Saprospira?
The same arguments might apply to considerations of gliding ability (Reichenbach et al., 1986).
Furthermore, on the basis of present MB data, different Saprospira-like microbes may exhibit affinities with microbes from other diverse genera, indicative of considerable phylogenetic diversity within the named genus.
Although we cannot reconcile visual and MB classifications, we can at least make some workable arrangements.
We must, if we need to name things.
If we have to depend solely on what we can see under the microscope, then the broad generic name, Saprospira, is all we can use.
But when objective MB data indicate otherwise, I think we will have to reassign – and rename – the diverse groups accordingly.
Following a proposition of Lewin (1962), nonphototrophic, helical, multicellular, filamentous bacteria with gliding motility were classified in the genus Saprospira.
The genus had been defined earlier by Gross (1911), and his Saprospira grandis is very probably identical with Lewin's strains.
Only the “spore” formation described by Gross and included in the species definition of Saprospira grandis has not been observed again and had to be discarded from the description.
The present taxa are based, of course, on Lewin”s more recent and more detailed investigations and his neotype strain.
Lewin later described several other species, viz., “Saprospira thermalis” (freshwater; Lewin, 1965a), “Saprospira flammula” (freshwater; Lewin, 1965a) and “Saprospira toviformis” (marine; Lewin and Mandel, 1970), and revived another old species, “Spirulina albida” Kolkwitz (1909), as “Saprospira albida” (freshwater; Lewin, 1962).
Although the assumption is supported by correspondences in several morphological and physiological characteristics, it was not certain whether all these organisms are really related to one another, as no molecular taxonomic data were available.
The mol% G+C range of 35–48 would at least not rule out a relatively close relationship.
Unfortunately, except for Saprospira grandis, the type strains of all species have been lost, so that these species were not included in the Approved Lists of Bacterial Names.
However, the organisms have been fairly well characterized, and there is no doubt that they really exist; their characteristics are given in detail by Reichenbach (1989).,4, 5
I am grateful to S. Aizawa and X. Mayali for their useful suggestions.
On the basis of analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, Sly et al.
(1998) reported that Saprospira grandis is closely related to the Haliscomenobacter (Sly et al., 1998).
Hosoya et al.
(2006) reported that Saprospira grandis was related to Haliscomenobacter and Lewinella, and also found it closely related to their new genus Aureispira.
Thus, the family Saprospiraceae would presently contain four genera - Saprospira, Haliscomenobacter, Lewinella, and Aureispira.

Type species: Sorangium cellulosum (Brockman 1989b) comb.
nov. (Polyangium cellulosum (ex Imshenetski and Solntseva 1936) Brockman 1989b, 495.)
Number of validated species: 1
Jahn created the genus Sorangium to comprise species with sori composed of relatively small, angular sporangioles.
He also established a family for the genus, the “Sorangiaceae”.
However, this strict separation of the genera Sorangium and Polyangium was probably a misjudgment, and most of his Sorangium species are now classified in the older genus Polyangium.
One subgroup among the old Polyangium and Sorangium species includes efficient cellulose degraders, and it is suggested here that the genus name Sorangium be used for them, and exclusively so.
In the author's experience cellulose degradation is a unique and very stable characteristic, so that a separate genus Sorangium for such organisms may be justified.
There are other unusual characteristics that distinguish Sorangium from Polyangium, such as growth on inorganic nitrogen compounds as the sole nitrogen source, absence of lanosterol synthesis, no etching of the agar surface, much elevated kanamycin resistance, and a different pattern of secondary metabolites.
At the moment, only one species, S. cellulosum will be described although it appears to be a complex of several morphological and physiological variants that may represent different species, as will be discussed in more detail below.
Until recently, S. cellulosum was the only established cellulose degrader among myxobacteria.
But now a new genus and species, Byssophaga cruenta, is being added to this group (see above).
In their pioneering article on cellulose-decomposing myxobacteria, Krzemieniewska and Krzemieniewski (1937a) mentioned two forms of Archangium that decomposed cellulose.
However, they were not sure whether the fruiting bodies of those strains were not just immature specimens of a Sorangium, and therefore did not name them.
This seems to be the correct interpretation.
Other myxobacteria stated to be cellulose degraders might have been contaminants in cellulose-decomposing cultures.

Strains of S. cellulosum were found to have very large genomes, 10–12.2 Mbp.
Cellulose-degrading myxobacteria are very common and have been isolated from all kinds of soils and environments from Russia and Sweden in the north to semiarid areas and tropical rain forests in the south.
S. cellulosum clearly is a complex of several species.
However, as most phenotypic characteristics of those organisms are extremely variable, all efforts at subdivision of this group of strains have failed so far.
A comparative study making use of modern methods of molecular taxonomy may help to solve the problem.

Multiplication is unequal, and division proceeds by constriction.
Prosthecae between cells have not been observed.
Prosthecae are formed by local polar growth of the cell wall together with the cytoplasmic membrane.
Additional chlorosomes are synthesized in emerging prosthecae.
The process of prostheca formation resembles budding, but ultrathin sections of prosthecae do not reveal DNA filaments.
Prosthecae may branch.
The genus Ancalochloris is characterized by the starlike shape of the cells and the possession of gas vesicles.
The prosthecae differ from those of Prosthecochloris by their greater length and tapering ends.
The use of pure cultures is required to clarify the systematic position of Ancalochloris and its relationship to other genera of the green sulfur bacteria.

Though similar in phenotypic and physiological characteristics, Sporosarcina species may also be distinguished on the basis of phenotypic differences (see Table 1).
The cells of some species occur singly or in pairs (Sporosarcina globisporus, Sporosarcina koreensis, and Sporosarcina macmurdoensis), whereas others also form clusters or short chains (Sporosarcina psychrophila and Sporosarcina soli).
Endospores can be terminal (Sporosarcina aquimarina, Sporosarcina globispora, Sporosarcina koreensis, Sporosarcina pasteurii, Sporosarcina psychrophila, and Sporosarcina saromensis), subterminal (Sporosarcina macmurdoensis), or central (Sporosarcina soli).
Only two species are nonmotile (Sporosarcina macmurdoensis and Sporosarcina soli).
All species tested are catalase positive.
Only one species is negative for urease and oxidase (Sporosarcina macmurdoensis).
While Sporosarcina pasteurii is positive for urease, it has not been tested for catalase and oxidase.

By 16S rRNA sequencing, the closest relative of Stygiolobus is Sulfolobus acidocaldarius with a phylogenetic distance of 5%.
However, due to the great distances of the representatives of the genus Sulfolobus to each other (see also Genus Sulfolobus), no closer relationship is obvious to the other Sulfolobus species (Fuchs et al., 1996a).

The botanical family “Nostocaceae” (comprising all genera of Subsection IV.I, except Scytonema) was subdivided by Komárek and Anagnostidis (1989) into two subfamilies, “Anabaenoideae” and “Nostocoideae” (Komárek and Anagnostidis, 1989).
The former included all genera in which akinete formation is initiated adjacent (or very close) to heterocysts, whereas the latter subfamily was restricted to members that initiate akinetes equidistant between two heterocysts.
However, as demonstrated by morphological studies and DNA–DNA hybridization for Anabaena, both types of akinete pattern may occur in different “species” of the same genus (Stulp and Stam, 1982, 1984a).

Some genera (e.g., Chlorogloeopsis, Fischerella, Iyengariella, Herpyzonema, Mastigocladopsis, Nostochopsis, Stigonema, Westiella) have been studied in uni-cyanobacterial culture, but only two, Fischerella and Chlorogloeopsis, have been recharacterized using axenic culture strains.
However, it is certain from field observations that several other genera exist and have not yet been cultured.
Geitler (1932) included seven families and 29 genera.
Bourrelly (1985) retained six families and 35 freshwater genera within the Stigonematales.
Anagnostidis and Komárek (1990) reorganized the order at the family level and recognized eight families with 48 genera.
Because of the large number of genera and species, few of which have been obtained in culture, only 6 genera are described here.
The following simplified key includes few of the genera considered by Bourrelly (1985) and Anagnostidis and Komárek (1990), but gives an overview of the morphological diversity of the group.

Sulfophobococcus can be isolated in a mineral medium supplemented with 0.1% yeast extract.
Isolates are obtained by growth of successive serial dilutions of the enrichment in the same medium.
The 16S rRNA phylogeny groups Sulfophobococcus with Desulfurococcus.
A 95.5% similarity in sequence suggests that the isolate should be incorporated as a member of the Desulfurococcales.
However, the distinctive physiological and chemotaxonomic differences of these two genera will require a reassessment of the description of the Desulfurococcales.
Furthermore, the Sulfophobococcus 16S rRNA contains a number of deviations from the known crenarchaeotal sequences at positions where all Crenarchaeota have conserved bases.
Examples are at positions 45/470, 1017/1028, and 1052/1088.

Type species: Sulfurococcus mirabilis Golovacheva, Val'ekho-Roman and Troitski 1995, 880 (Effective publication: Golovacheva, Val'ekho-Roman and Troitski 1987, 91).

The distinguishing characteristic of Sulfurococcus is its ability to reproduce by binary fission and budding.
The mode of budding is reminiscent of that found in Thermoproteus, Thermofilum, Pyrodictium and Thermodiscus.
One to five buds develop on the cell surface or on hyphae-like appendages that are about 10 nm in diameter and can be 3–4 µm in length.
The cells that arise are small (~0.3 µm in diameter).
A similar mode of reproduction has not been reported for the close relative, Sulfolobus.
The mol% G + C of the DNA of the two species of Sulfurococcus is distinct from Sulfolobus (mol% G + C is 36–38) and closer to Metallosphaera sedula (mol% G + C is 43.7–46.7).
The DNA–DNA similarity (1–7%) confirms the closer relationship of Sulfurococcus yellowstonensis with M. sedula strain TH-2.
The 5S rRNA sequence comparisons place the two species of Sulfurococcus within the same clade of the Sulfolobales lineage.
The 5S rRNA sequences of Sulfurococcus yellowstonensis and Sulfurococcus mirabilis are 95.4% similar, and the sequence similarity between Sulfurococcus and Sulfolobus solfataricus is 75–79%.
The 5S rRNA sequence comparisons places Sulfurococcus within the Sulfolobales.
From both 5S rRNA data and DNA–DNA hybridization results, Sulfurococcus is a distinct genus from Sulfolobus.
However, the physiological characteristics of the two genera are very similar, and confirmation of separate genera using 16S rRNA sequences may be required.
Additionally, the primary characteristic used to distinguish Sulfurococcus from other members of the Sulfolobales was its ability to reproduce by budding.
Although there is no report of budding in Sulfolobus, it is possible that this aspect of the morphology of this genus has been overlooked, and that budding is not restricted to Sulfurococcus.
The two species of Sulfurococcus are more clearly defined, based on their ability to oxidize sulfide minerals and Fe2+, different 5S rRNA sequences, low DNA–DNA homologies, and different optimum temperatures for growth.
Only two species are described; Sulfurococcus mirabilis and Sulfurococcus yellowstonensis.
These have been distinguished on the basis of their 5S rRNA structure, DNA–DNA hybridization results, and ability to oxidize Fe2+.

Members of the genus Thermicanus are currently represented by a single species, i.e., the type species Thermicanus aegyptius.
Thermicanus aegyptius is phylogenetically distantly related to the genera Paenibacillus, Oxalophagus, Bacillus, and Thermoactinomyces.
Sequence similarity of the 16S rRNA gene of Thermicanus aegyptius to that of its closest relative approximates 88% (Gössner, Devereux, Ohnemuller, Acker, Stackebrandt and Drake, 1999).
The type species, Thermicanus aegyptius, was isolated from soil obtained from Egypt (Gössner, Devereux, Ohnemuller, Acker, Stackebrandt and Drake, 1999).
A near pH neutral medium designed for the enrichment of acetogens was inoculated with soil and incubated at 55°C.
An isolated colony obtained from an anoxic streak plate prepared from an acetogenic enrichment contained two organisms designated ET-5a (a new strain of the acetogen Moorella thermoacetica, DSM 12797) and ET-5b (Thermicanus aegyptius).
Thermicanus aegyptius was subsequently enriched and isolated from the co-culture by selective cultivation on cellobiose under oxic conditions.

Thermodiscus belongs to the Desulfurococcaceae based on its 16S rRNA sequence and metabolic properties.
The genus Thermodiscus differs from all other genera of the Desulfurococcaceae by its 16S rRNA sequence (Burggraf et al., 1997b) and its disk-shaped cell morphology (Stetter, 1986a).
By 16S rRNA sequence comparisons, Thermodiscus is among the Desulfurococcaceae and is specifically related to Aeropyrum pernix (Burggraf et al., 1997b).

Phylogenetically, the genus Turicibacter is distantly related to other taxa of the Firmicutes.
Similarities of the 16S rRNA gene sequence with those of other genera are less than 88% (Bosshard et al., 2002).
According to the 16S rRNA phylogenetic analysis presented in the roadmap to this volume, the genus Turicibacter is a deep branch of the family Erysipelotrichaceae, order Erysipelotrichales, class Erysipelotrichia in the phylum Firmicutes.
However, there are reasons to be cautious about this assignment.
Placements of deep branches in phylogenetic trees are frequently problematic and subject to change as additional sequences or improved methods become available.
Moreover, the other Erysipelotrichaceae are aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, whereas Turicibacter is strictly anaerobic.
Therefore, this classification warrants further investigation.

Type species: Waddlia chondrophila Rurangirwa, Dilbeck, Crawford, McGuire and McElwain 1999, 580VP.
Strains do not react with antisera from other species used for typing the chlamydiae or rickettsiae.
The 16S rRNA genes are most closely related to that of the Chlamydiaceae because they exhibit 80–90% similarity to strains of that family.
Number of validated species: 1
Rurangirwa, Dilbeck, Crawford, McGuire and McElwain 1999, 580VP
Gram-stain-negative, coccoid bacteria 0.2–0.5 µm in diameter which are obligately intracellular parasites of cattle.
Waddlia chondrophila was isolated from the tissues of a bovine fetus, which was aborted in the first trimester.
This organism's description is identical to that of “WSU 86–1044” that was reported by Dilbeck et al.
(1990) and Kocan, Crawford, Dilbeck, Evermann and McGuire (1990).
The species includes only the type strain, WSU 86–1044T (=ATCC VR 1470T).
The full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence is 15% different from that of Chlamydiaceae species.
Furthermore, it is 12.8% different from Parachlamydia acanthamoebae and 15% different from Simkania negevensis thereby justifying its placement in a separate family of the Chlamydiales (Everett, Bush and Andersen, 1999).
Although there are no other validly published species in the genus Waddlia, a strain obtained from bats has been reported.
Based upon 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses it is most closely related to Waddlia chondrophila.
A new species was proposed for the bat parasites, “Waddlia malaysiensis”, but its name has not been validated (Chua, Corkill, Hooi, Cheng, Winstanley and Hart, 2005).

Data are taken from: Barbeyron, L'Haridon, Corre, Kloareg and Potin (2001), Bowman (2000), Bruns, Rohde and Berthe-Corti (2001), Cho and Giovannoni (2004), Nedashkovskaya, Suzuki, Vancanneyt, Cleenwerck, Lysenko, Mikhailov and Swings (2004f), Reichenbach (1989a), Yoon et al.
(2005b), and ZoBell and Upham (1944).
Zobellia strains differ from those of all their close relatives, i.e., members of the genera Arenibacter, Maribacter, Muricauda and Robiginitalea, by their production of flexirubin-type pigments (Bruns, Rohde and Berthe-Corti, 2001; Cho and Giovannoni, 2004; Nedashkovskaya, Suzuki, Vysotskii and Mikhailov, 2003b, 2004a, 2004b, 2004f, 2006g; Yoon, Kang, Lee, Lee and Oh, 2005b).
Also, Zobellia strains can be differentiated from those of Arenibacter, Muricauda, and Robiginitalea by their ability to hydrolyze agar.
Moreover, Zobellia strains liquefy gelatin, move by gliding, and reduce nitrate to nitrite, in contrast to strains of Muricauda and Robiginitalea.

Three distinct morphological forms, representing different developmental stages, have been observed inside the host-derived vacuole that surrounded the bacteria.
The proposed reticulate bodies are large pleomorphic cells (up to 2 µm) with an inner structure resembling the reticulate bodies of Chlamydiaceae (Figure 1).
The proposed intermediate bodies were slightly smaller with a condensed cytoplasm.
The proposed elementary bodies were about 1 µm long and consisted of a head and a tail region (Figure 1).
Transitional forms between these three developmental stages have been observed (Karlsen, Nylund, Watanabe, Helvik, Nylund and Plarre, 2008).
Bacteria with a similar morphology have previously been observed in the gills of steelhead trout and lake trout, and in nonproliferative gill lesions of Atlantic salmon (Bradley, Newcomer and Maxwell, 1988; Draghi, Popov, Kahl, Stanton, Brown, Tsongalis, West and Frasca, 2004; Rourke, Davis and Bradley, 1984), but these bacteria were never identified on a molecular level.
“Candidatus Clavichlamydia salmonicola” has been found infecting the gills of salmonid fish in freshwater (Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar, and wild brown trout, Salmo trutta), forming large cysts (up to 56 µm) consisting of single hypertrophied epithelial cells.
Although a direct causal relationship has not yet been demonstrated, “Candidatus Clavichlamydia salmonicola” has been suggested to represent one possible etiological agent of epitheliocystis in fish from freshwater and marine environments (Karlsen, Nylund, Watanabe, Helvik, Nylund and Plarre, 2008).
The two available 16S rRNA sequences from the genus Clavichlamydia share slightly greater than 90% similarity with the 16S rRNA sequences of Chlamydia abortus, Chlamydia felis, Chlamydia pecorum, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci, but slightly less than 90% with Chlamydia muridarum, Chlamydia suis, and Chlamydia trachomatis.
While the unique morphology of the developmental stages of members of the genus “Candidatus Clavichlamydia” might favor the placement of this genus into a new family separate from the Chlamydiaceae, this might be subject to change when more sequence information and additional descriptions become available.
The names Clavochlamydiaceae, Clavochlamydia, and “Candidatus Clavochlamydia salmonicola” have been changed by the editors to “Candidatus Clavichlamydiaceae”, “Candidatus Clavichlamydia”, and “Candidatus Clavichlamydia salmonicola” during preparation of this chapter.
The connecting vowel must be “i” because the first part of the name is derived from Latin.
